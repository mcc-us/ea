Education Credits
How to Claim the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) on Form 8863

The U.S. provides generally 2 main tax credits / deductions for higher education expenses
    1. American Opportunity Tax Credit (IRS Form 8863)
    2. Lifetime Learning Tax Credit (IRS Form 8863)

American Opportunity Tax Credit
        Covers ONLY first 4 years of “Under-grad”
        Preferable tax credit bc larger amounts & the credit is on a per student basis (for parents with multiple kids in college, can claim multiple credits in the same year)
        The student must be pursuing a degree (they cannot simply be taking classes for fun or part of a non-degree program).
        Credit up to $2,500 of education expenses.
            100% of the first $2,000, & then 25% of expenses over 2k, but capped at 500.

    Lifetime Learning tax Credit
        Credit can apply all the way through grad-school, so it is not limited to the first 4 years of college.
        Credit is available on a per taxpayer basis (only one person can claim per year).
        Can be claimed even if not pursuing a degree (i.e., just taking classes for fun)

    Example: John Doe is 20 years old & is enrolled as a full-time at a university studying Accounting. He is in his third year of college. John also works a full-time for a call center where he is allowed to work from home.

    Example 2: Jon received form 1098-T which shows his tuition for the 2023 calendar year totaled $5,200 & his W2 wages from his job were 32,000. Jon has already claimed the AOTC for the previous two years (Freshman & Sophomore).
