Rosa and Keith are both 70 years old. They are married and file jointly. In the current year, Rosa received $7,000 of Social Security benefits and Keith received $11,000. Rosa also received a taxable pension of $8,000 and Keith received a taxable pension of $12,000. What is the taxable portion of their Social Security benefits?

    A. $0correct
    B. $19,000wrong
    C. $9,000
    D. $18,000

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 68% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

None of their Social Security benefits are taxable. To determine if any percentage of Social Security benefits is taxable, a taxpayer must compare the “base amount” for the taxpayer’s filing status with the total of:

    One-half of social security benefits, plus
    All of the taxpayer’s other income, including tax-exempt interest.

If the sum is less than the base amount for the taxpayer’s filing status, none of the Social Security is taxable. If the sum is more than the base amount for his filing status, a percentage of their Social Security is taxable. The base amount for taxpayers filing jointly is $32,000 ($25,000 for other filing statuses). The answer is calculated as follows: Half of Rosa and Keith’s $18,000 combined Social Security benefits is $9,000. Adding in $20,000 of taxable pensions, the total is $29,000, which is less than the $32,000 base amount for their filing status, meaning none of their Social Security benefits are taxable. The taxable portion of Social Security benefits is never more than 85% and in most cases is less than 50%.

Like-kind exchanges are only permitted for real property (i.e. real estate). Like-kind properties are properties of the same nature or character, even if they differ in grade or quality. For example, an exchange of city property for farm property is a like-kind exchange, as is improved property for unimproved property. To see more information about Section 1031 exchanges, see the IRS page for Like-Kind Exchanges.

    C. Yes, he is eligible for the educator expense deduction. He can deduct $325 as an adjustment to income.
    D. No, he is not eligible for the deduction because he is not a full-time instructor. He cannot deduct any expenses.wrong

Study Unit 11: Adjustments to Gross Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 80% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Gary is eligible for the educator expense deduction. He can deduct $225 as an adjustment to income. The cost of the reproductive health pamphlets are not a qualifying expense.  School supplies for courses on health and physical education qualify only if they are related to athletics. An "eligible educator" is a kindergarten through grade 12 teacher, instructor, counselor, principal, or aide who worked in a school for at least 900 hours during a school year. The required minimum is 900 hours during the school year.

For 2023, an eligible educator can deduct up to $300 of qualifying expenses. If they're married and file a joint return with another eligible educator, the limit rises to $600 ($300 for each spouse). To review more information on this topic, see Topic No. 458 Educator Expense Deduction.

15. Question ID: 94849530 (Topic: Medicare Waiver and Disability Payments)

Study Unit 4: Taxable and Nontaxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 79% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

All the income she gets from workers' compensation, including the $5,000 settlement, is non-taxable to her. Settlements for injury and sickness are generally nontaxable to the recipient. And worker’s compensation is also non-taxable, because it is a type of benefit that is offered to employees who are injured at work.

20. Question ID: 95399827 (Topic: Basis of Assets - General)

Gerard owns 100 shares of Sustainable Fisheries, Inc. stock, which he purchased five years ago for $1,500. On May 1, Sustainable Fisheries issues a stock dividend of 50 additional shares. Gerard sells 60 shares on December 28. What is his adjusted basis in the 60 shares that he sold?

    A. $500
    B. $2,250
    C. $600correct
    D. $900wrong

Study Unit 6: Calculating the Basis of Assets covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 65% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Gerard’s basis in the original stock was $1,500 for 100 shares, so his original basis per share was $15 ($1,500/100). The addition of 50 shares means Gerard’s adjusted basis per share decreased to $10 per share ($1,500/150). Therefore, his basis in the 60 shares he sold in December is $600 ($10 adjusted basis per share × 60).

23. Question ID: 94849619 (Topic: Fringe Benefits)

Dusty is a full-time employee of Frosty's Ice Cream. He was required to use his car to run errands for his employer. His employer’s mileage reimbursement was $0.50 per mile, and he is reimbursed under an accountable plan. If Dusty's actual expenses are more than the reimbursement, where can he deduct the excess amount?

    A. He cannot deduct any excess mileage, but his employer's reimbursements are not taxable. correct
    B. He can deduct the excess mileage expenses as a miscellaneous itemized deduction. wrong
    C. He can deduct the excess mileage expenses as an adjustment to income. 
    D. On Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business. 

Study Unit 4: Taxable and Nontaxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 64% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Dusty cannot deduct any excess mileage, but his employer's reimbursements are not taxable. Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, most taxpayers can no longer claim any miscellaneous itemized deductions that are subject to the 2%-of-AGI limitation, including unreimbursed employee expenses.

24. Question ID: 94849658 (Topic: Capital Gains and Losses)

Haley purchased stock in a mutual fund six years ago for $200. On January 1, she received a non-dividend distribution of $160. She did not include this amount in her income, but she reduced the basis of her stock to $40. On December 31, Haley received another non-dividend distribution of $60. What amount of gain, (if any), must Haley report from these transactions, and what is her new basis in the stock?

    A. Basis: $60; no gain.
    B. Basis: $40; long-term capital gain: $60.wrong
    C. Basis: $0; no gain.
    D. Basis: $0; long-term capital gain: $20.correct

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 73% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

The first $40 of the non-dividend distribution reduces the basis of Haley’s stock to zero. She must report the other $20 as a long-term capital gain. The answer is figured as follows:
Beginning cost basis: $200
Minus non-dividend distribution: ($160)
New basis: $40
The second non-dividend distribution ($60) reduces her stock basis to $0.
The remaining $20 must be reported as a capital gain.

5. Question ID: 94849544 (Topic: Taxable Government Benefits)

Reggie lives in an area that was hit hard by a hurricane. His home was destroyed and he was forced to move into a motel for several months.

    C. He must declare it as income on his tax return. The amounts are not subject to self-employment tax, but they are subject to regular income tax.
    D. He must reimburse the federal government for the payment within a period of five years. The disaster payments are a loan. If the amounts are not repaid, the amount becomes cancelled debt income.

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 84% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

The amounts are not taxable. Disaster relief payments that are made to reimburse or pay for reasonable and necessary personal, family, living, or funeral expenses after a qualified disaster are excluded from a taxpayer’s income. They are not taxable and do not need to be reported on the taxpayer’s individual return.

6. Question ID: 94849673 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)

Dinar had $8,000 of credit card debt, which he did not pay. He received a Form 1099-C from his credit card company showing canceled debt of $8,000. Immediately before the cancellation, Dinar’s total liabilities were $17,000 and the FMV of his total assets was $6,000. Given these facts, which of the following statements is correct?

    A. Dinar can deduct a loss of $8,000 on his income tax return.
    B. Dinar must report $8,000 of canceled debt income on his income tax return.
    C. Dinar can exclude $11,000 from his taxable income.
    D. Dinar can exclude $8,000 of canceled debt from income because he is insolvent.correct

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 73% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Dinar can exclude $8,000 of canceled debt from income because he is insolvent. A taxpayer is insolvent when his total debts are more than the FMV of his total assets. For this purpose the taxpayer’s assets include the value of everything he owns, including pensions and retirement accounts. Dinar is insolvent (as his $17,000 of liabilities exceeds his $6,000 of assets), so he can exclude the entire $8,000 of canceled debt from his income. He must file a Form 982 with his tax return and check the box for "insolvency".

"Income is constructively received when an amount is credited to your account or made available to you without restriction. You do not need to have possession of it. If you authorize someone to be your agent and receive income for you, you are considered to have received it when your agent receives it. Income is not constructively received if your control of its receipt is subject to substantial restrictions or limitations." -Publication 538

    $500 interest from a certificate of deposit.
    $15 interest from a savings account.
    $240 dividend from a mutual fund.
    $1,750 of dividends from stocks.

Marissa reinvested the $500 in interest into a new CD along with the maturing principal. The earnings from the mutual fund are also not distributed and are used to purchase additional shares.

Study Unit 5: Investment Income and Expenses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 69% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

All the amounts must be reported as taxable income. Marissa must report $515 in interest income and $1,990 in dividends on Schedule B. Cash-method taxpayers must generally report interest income in the year in which they actually or constructively receive it. Even if the earnings are reinvested, the interest or earnings must still be reported as income in the year received.

13. Question ID: 94849687 (Topic: Royalty Income)

Taryn is an investor that likes to purchase intangible property. Six years ago, Taryn purchased a patent from the inventor of a new type of contact lens. Taryn did not create the patent but rather bought the patent as an investment. A few years later, she successfully markets the patent to a contact lens manufacturer. In 2023, she received $80,000 of royalty income from sales of the patented contact lens. How is this income reported on her tax return?

    A. On her Schedule D, taxed as capital gains.
    B. No reporting is required.
    C. On her Schedule E, taxed as ordinary income that is not subject to self-employment tax.correct
    D. On her Schedule C, taxed as ordinary income that is subject to self-employment tax.

Study Unit 9: Rental and Royalty Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 71% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Because Taryn did not create the patent herself, the royalty income is reported on Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss. The income is taxed as ordinary income, subject to income tax, but not subject to self-employment tax.

14. Question ID: 94849690 (Topic: How Much Income to Report)

Taralyn owns a pet grooming business that operates on the cash basis. She receives the following from customers:

    $50 check from customer #1 on December 24, 2023.
    $75 credit card payment from customer #2 on December 28, 2023.
    $60 check from customer #3 on December 29, 2023.
    $100 credit card payment from customer #4 on December 30, 2023.
    $50 IOU from customer #5 on December 31, 2023.

Taralyn receives payment on the $50 IOU from customer #5 on January 12, 2024. She deposits the check from customer #3 on January 3, 2024. What amount must Taralyn include on her Schedule C for 2023?

    A. $285correct
    B. $50
    C. $110
    D. $335

Study Unit 4: Taxable and Nontaxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 75% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

The IOU payment is not included in income in 2023 because Taralyn does not yet have "constructive receipt" of the income. She has constructive receipt of all of the other items, including the check from customer #3 that she chooses not to deposit until the following year. The doctrine of constructive receipt requires that cash-basis taxpayers be taxed on income when it becomes available, regardless of whether it is actually in their physical possession. However, an IOU is merely a promise to pay, not an actual payment. 

16. Question ID: 94849543 (Topic: Dividend and Distribution Income)

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the holding period for qualified dividends?

    A. The taxpayer must hold the stock for 60 days, not including the ex-dividend date.
    B. The taxpayer must hold the stock for 121 days, including the ex-dividend date.
    C. The taxpayer must hold the stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days after the ex-dividend date.
    D. The taxpayer must hold the stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date.correct

Study Unit 5: Investment Income and Expenses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 49% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Qualified dividends are given favorable tax treatment. However, a taxpayer must hold the dividends for the required period of time in order to qualify for these preferred tax rates. He must generally have held the stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend date is the date following the declaration of a dividend. When figuring the holding period for qualified dividends, the taxpayer should count the number of days he held the stock and include the day he disposed of the stock. The date the taxpayer acquires the stock is not included in the holding period.

17. Question ID: 94849712 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)

Margarida is single. During the year, she earns $49,000 in wages, $2,000 of passive income from a limited partnership interest, and $3,500 of passive loss from a rental real estate activity in which she actively participated. She had no other activity for the year. How should this income be reported on her tax return?

    A. $2,000 of her ($3,500) rental loss can offset her passive income on Schedule E. The remaining ($1,500) in rental losses are lost and cannot be deducted.
    B. $2,000 of her ($3,500) rental loss can offset her passive income on Schedule E. The remaining ($1,500) in rental losses must be carried over to a future year.
    C. $2,000 of her ($3,500) rental loss can offset her passive income on Schedule C. The remaining ($1,500) in rental losses must be carried over to future years.
    D. $2,000 of her ($3,500) rental loss can offset her passive income on Schedule E. The remaining ($1,500) in rental losses can be deducted from her wages on Form 1040.correct

Study Unit 9: Rental and Royalty Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 63% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

If a taxpayer actively participated in a passive rental real estate activity, they may be able to deduct up to $25,000 of loss from the activity from their non-passive income. This special allowance is an exception to the general rule, disallowing losses in excess of income from passive activities. Similarly, the taxpayer may be able to offset credits from the activity against the tax on up to $25,000 of non-passive income after taking into account any losses allowed under this exception. Therefore, in the above scenario, $2,000 of her passive income is offset by her rental losses. The remaining ($1,500) in rental losses can be deducted from her $49,000 wages. See Publication 527, Residential Rental Property, for more examples.

18. Question ID: 94849603 (Topic: Employee Compensation and Worker Classification)

Which of the following individuals would NOT be considered self-employed?

    B. A sole-proprietor that files a Schedule F. 
    C. A licensed real estate agent working on commission.
    D. A shareholder-employee in an S corporation. correct

Study Unit 4: Taxable and Nontaxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 76% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

A shareholder-employee of an S corporation would not be considered self-employed; they are employees of the S corporation. All of the other individuals listed would be considered self-employed persons. Generally, a person is self-employed if any of the following apply:

    You carry on a trade or business as a sole proprietor or an independent contractor.
    You are a member of a partnership that carries on a trade or business.

In addition, licensed real estate agents are statutory non-employees and are treated as self-employed by statute. To learn more about the Self-Employment individuals, see the Self-employed Individuals Tax Center. 

19. Question ID: 94815835 (Topic: Hobby Income)

When is an activity considered to be a hobby, rather than a business?

    A. An activity is considered a hobby rather than a business when the activity is creative or pleasurable in nature.
    B. An activity is considered a hobby rather than a business when it is not carried on to make a profit.correct
    C. An activity is considered a hobby rather than a business when it is seasonal.
    D. An activity is considered a hobby rather than a business when it sustains losses for two years.

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 72% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

An activity is considered a hobby rather than a business when it is not carried on to make a profit. A taxpayer will often engage in a hobby for sport or recreation, not to make a profit. Taxpayers must report income earned from hobbies, but the expenses are not deductible. Sometimes, taxpayers will improperly try to deduct losses from a hobby activity on Schedule C. The IRS allows a presumption that the taxpayer is "engaged in an activity for profit if in 3 of 5 consecutive years the activity is profitable (2 of 7 in the case of breeding, training, showing or racing of horses). See IRC § 183: Activities Not Engaged in For Profit.

21. Question ID: 94850146 (Topic: Taxation for Clergy and Military)

Celia is an ordained minister for the Unitarian Church. During the current year, she received the following compensation and payments from the church:

    Salary: $65,000
    Housing allowance (parsonage): $24,000
    Fees for performing weddings: $750
    Fees for performing funerals: $300
    Reimbursement from her employer for travel expenses on church business: $210

All of the housing allowance (or parsonage) was used for mortgage payments, including property taxes and insurance. Celia itemizes deductions and deducts the mortgage interest and real estate taxes on Schedule A. What amount must Celia include in her gross income?

    A. $66,050correct
    B. $1,260
    C. $90,260
    D. $1,050

Study Unit 4: Taxable and Nontaxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 71% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Celia can exclude from gross income the rental value of a home or a rental allowance to the extent it is used to provide her home as part of her compensation. An ordained clergy member must include in income her salary and any fees for personal services, such as those received for performing weddings, baptisms, and funerals ($65,000 + $750 + $300). A minister can deduct mortgage interest and real estate taxes paid on a personal residence even if the taxes result from a housing allowance that is excluded from gross income. The reimbursement for travel expenses is not taxable income to Celia if it is made under an accountable plan. For more information about the special rules that apply to clergy, see Publication 517, Social Security and Other Information for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers.
