If you sell something and receive payments over time, and the interest rate on those payments is very low or nonexistent, the IRS may consider that you're earning interest that isn't explicitly stated in the agreement. This is called unstated interest or original issue discount. 
Even if you end up losing money on the deal, you might still owe taxes on this unstated interest.


In this scenario, Peggy's tax liability from the sale of the land remains unchanged. The sale between Zeke and another buyer does not affect Peggy's tax obligations. She will continue to recognize the gain from the original sale over the five-year period, as outlined in the installment sale agreement. 

Zeke's sale of the land to another buyer is a separate transaction and will have tax implications for him, but it doesn't impact Peggy's tax position.

Income recapture is a tax rule that requires taxpayers to pay ordinary income tax on a portion of the gain from the sale of certain assets, such as depreciated property or Section 1245 property. 

**How it works:**

When you sell a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted basis, the excess amount is typically treated as a capital gain. However, if the asset is subject to recapture rules, a portion of the gain may be taxed at ordinary income rates. This is because you've already received tax benefits from depreciating the asset over time. 

**Common Examples of Recapture:**

* **Section 1245 Property:** This includes property like machinery and equipment. A portion of the gain on the sale of Section 1245 property is recaptured as ordinary income.
* **Section 1250 Property:** This typically includes real estate. Recapture rules apply to depreciation claimed on real estate, especially for accelerated depreciation methods.

By understanding income recapture, you can better plan your tax strategy and minimize your tax liability when selling assets.

A contingent payment sale is when the seller gets paid only if/when it occurs first. For example, a writer might get paid for a book only if it sells a certain number of copies. The amount of money and when the seller gets paid are not known for sure at the beginning.

A contingent payment sale is a transaction where the seller receives payment for goods or services that is contingent upon the occurrence of a specific event or condition. The amount and timing of the payment are uncertain at the time of the sale.

**Common Examples:**

* **Royalty Payments:** When a seller receives royalties based on future sales or usage of their product or intellectual property.
* **Performance-Based Compensation:** When a salesperson or executive receives a bonus based on meeting specific performance targets.
* **Sales Commissions:** When a salesperson earns a commission on future sales.

**Tax Implications:**

* **Income Recognition:** The seller generally recognizes income as the contingency is satisfied and the payment is received.
* **Basis Adjustment:** The seller may need to adjust the basis of the property sold to reflect the contingent payments received.

It's important to note that the specific tax treatment of contingent payment sales can be complex and depends on various factors, including the nature of the contingency, the timing of payments, and applicable tax laws. Consulting with a tax professional can help ensure accurate tax reporting for such transactions.
