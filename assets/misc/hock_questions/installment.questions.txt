Peggy sold two acres of land to her brother, Zeke on January 1. She realized a gain of $50,000 on the sale. Zeke agreed to pay her in five annual installments, and Peggy treats the sale as an installment sale. On November 1, eleven months after he purchased the land, Zeke sold the land to another person. Zeke plans to keep making installment payments based on their original agreement. How does this sale affect Peggy?

    A. The new sale invalidates the earlier sale and Peggy will not have to report any gain.
    B. Both Zeke and Peggy will face IRS penalties for selling the land before the required two-year holding period for installment sales between related persons.
    C. There is no effect to Peggy from Zeke's sale of the land to another party.
    D. The installment sale method is disallowed to Peggy, and Peggy must report the entire gain of $50,000 on the sale, even though she has not received all the installment payments.


Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Installment sales to related persons are generally allowed. However, if a taxpayer sells property to a related person who then subsequently, the buyer sells or disposes of the property within two years of the original sale, the original seller will lose the benefit of installment sale reporting. Peggy must report the entire gain of $50,000, even though she has not received all of the installment payments.

Cassie sells a plot of land with an adjusted basis of $150,000 on January 1, 2023, under an installment sale. The buyer agrees to pay $200,000, with a cash down payment of $50,000 and $30,000 (plus 4% interest) in each of the next five years.

    B. Gross profit $50,000; $10,000 taxable.
    C. Gross profit $50,000; $12,500 taxable.correct
    D. Gross profit $25,000; $5,000 taxable.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

This is an installment sale. Cassie’s overall gross profit is $50,000 ($200,000 selling price - $150,000 adjusted basis), and her gross profit percentage is 25% ($50,000 ÷ $200,000). She must report 25% of each payment received (excluding the portion representing interest income) as gain from the sale. Thus, $12,500 (25% of the $50,000 down payment) is taxable in the current year. For more information on installment sales, see IRS Publication 537, Installment Sales.

4. Question ID: 94849635 (Topic: Installment Sales)

Mario sells a plot of farmland to his friend Natalie. The farmland has a basis of $70,000 and he sold it to Natalie for $140,000. Mario's gross profit is $70,000. Rather than using a bank loan, Mario offers to carry the note for Natalie, the buyer. Mario receives a $28,000 down payment on June 1, 2023, from Natalie, as well as a notarized buyer’s note for $112,000. The note provides for four annual payments of $28,000 plus 7% interest. Exclusive of the interest income, what amount must Mario report as taxable gain in 2023?

    A. $0
    B. $17,500
    C. $8,750
    D. $14,000correct


Correct Answer Explanation for D:

This is an installment sale. In this example, Mario’s gross profit percentage on the sale is 50% ($70,000 ÷ $140,000). He must report as his installment gain this same percentage of each $28,000 payment received ($28,000 × 50% = $14,000). In each year a taxpayer receives a payment related to an installment sale, he must report the interest income and the applicable portion of his gain on the sale. The taxpayer does not include in income the part that is the return of his basis in the property. This is the "installment sale method" of recognizing income.

Note: The “installment sale method” for reporting taxable income on an installment sale only applies when the taxpayer has a gain on the sale of the property. It does not apply when the taxpayer sells property at a loss. For more information about installment sales, see IRS Publication 537, Installment Sales. 

5. Question ID: 94849682 (Topic: Installment Sales)

Eveline sells a condo to her friend, Fred, for $200,000. Her basis was $150,000 and her gross profit is $50,000. Instead of using a lender, Eveline carries the note for her friend, and will receive five annual payments of $40,000, plus interest, until the note is paid off. She receives the first principal payment of $40,000 from Fred on December 30, 2023 She wants to use the installment method to report income from the sale. What is the amount of installment sale income that Eveline must report in the current year?

    A. $0
    B. $8,000
    C. $10,000correct
    D. $40,000


Correct Answer Explanation for C:

This is an example of an installment sale. Eveline's gross profit percentage is 25% ($50,000 annual payments ÷ $200,000 sales price). Eveline would report 25% of each principal payment, (25% × $40,000) = $10,000, as installment sale income from the sale for the tax year she receives the payment (after subtracting interest, if any). The balance of each payment, exclusive of interest, is the tax-free return of her adjusted basis.

Note: The "installment method" only applies when a taxpayer has a gain on the sale. If the taxpayer incurs a loss on the sale, the installment method does not apply. For more information, see IRS Publication 537, Installment Sales.
