 I want a bash command that will find all the .txt files in a directory, recursively, and append them to a new file called "compiled_part1_notes.md" 
 
```
find . -name "*.txt" -type f -exec cat {} \; >> compiled_part1_notes.md
```
 
 ```bash
find . -name "*.txt" -type f -exec cat {} \; >> compiled_part1_notes.md
```

**Explanation:**

* `find .`: Starts the `find` command in the current directory (`.`).
* `-name "*.txt"`:  Finds files ending in `.txt`.
* `-type f`:  Specifies that we are only looking for files (not directories).
* `-exec cat {} \;`: This is the core part.  For each file found:
    * `-exec`: Executes a command.
    * `cat {}`: The command to execute is `cat` (concatenate and print).  `{}` is a placeholder that `find` replaces with the actual filename.
    * `\;`:  Terminates the `-exec` command.  It's important to escape the semicolon with a backslash because the semicolon has special meaning in the shell.
* `>> compiled_part1_notes.md`: This redirects the output of the `cat` command (the contents of each `.txt` file) and *appends* it to the `compiled_part1_notes.md` file.  The `>>` operator is crucial; it appends.  If you used `>` it would overwrite the file each time.

* **Error Handling:**  This command doesn't handle errors (e.g., if a `.txt` file is unreadable).  For more robust error handling, you might consider using a loop:

```bash
find . -name "*.txt" -type f -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' file; do
  cat "$file" >> compiled_part1_notes.md
done
```
