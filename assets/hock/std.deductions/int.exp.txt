    They can deduct $36,455 in mortgage interest ($24,200 + $12,200 + $55 in late fees)
    They can also deduct $4,000 in investment interest expense (they incurred $5,000 of investment interest expense but only have $4,000 of net investment income, so their deduction for interest expense is limited to $4,000. The $1,000 excess can be carried over to succeeding tax years).

    $9,900 of mortgage interest on her vacation home in Hawaii
    $6,700 of loan interest on a cabin in Lake Tahoe that she uses occasionally when she wants to visit her family.

None of the homes are rentals. She is single and her AGI is $90,000. What is Selena’s maximum mortgage interest deduction on Schedule A?

    A. $33,600
    B. $24,900correct
    C. $31,600
    D. $15,000wrong

The property taxes of $2,000 would be deductible, but not as mortgage interest.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Only the mortgage interest is fully deductible. The real estate taxes and state taxes are subject to a $10,000 cap (also called the “SALT CAP”). The gambling losses are only deductible to the extent of gambling winnings. Thus, the answer is calculated as follows: $7,000 mortgage interest paid + $10,000 SALT CAP [$3,000 real estate taxes + $7,000 state income taxes (capped)]+ $1,000 allowable gambling losses = $18,000.

Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, most employee business expenses are no longer deductible on Schedule A (with the exception of work-related expenses of an Armed Forces reservist, qualified performing artist, fee-basis state or local government official, or employee with impairment-related work expenses.)

A taxpayer can deduct mortgage interest on up to two homes. A second home can include any other residence a taxpayer owns and treats as a home, but the taxpayer does not have to actually use the second home during the year in order to deduct the mortgage interest paid on the related loan. The late fees on her primary mortgage are also treated as mortgage interest for tax purposes. The HOA fees are not deductible on a personal residence. The interest on the timeshare is not deductible because she has already deducted the mortgage interest on two personal homes.
