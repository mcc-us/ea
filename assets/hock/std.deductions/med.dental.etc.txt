Last year, Jacob's 22 year old niece, Mary, was his dependent. In 2023, she no longer qualifies as his dependent because she is no longer a student and she earned $6,000 in wages, so she does not meet the gross income test to be claimed as a qualifying relative.

    B. Jacob can claim the $1,800 as an adjustment to income on his own return.
    C. Jacob cannot include his niece's medical expenses on his own tax return.
    D. Since she is not Jacob's dependent, Mary is the only one who can claim the $1,800 in medical expenses on her own return.wrong

Study Unit 12: Standard Deduction and Itemized Deductions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 67% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Jacob can include the $1,800 in figuring this year's medical expense deduction on his Schedule A. According to IRS Publication 502, "a taxpayer can deduct medical expenses you pay for yourself, as well as those you pay for someone who was your spouse or your dependent either when the services were provided or when you paid for them." Since Mary was Jacob's dependent when the services were provided, the amounts are deductible by Jacob if he is the one who paid them. (This question is based on a prior EA exam question).

5. Question ID: 94849995 (Topic: Medical, Dental, Vision, and Long-Term Care Expenses)

Dawn has multiple sclerosis and is in a wheelchair. She owns her home. During the current year, she paid the following amounts for improvements to her home to make it accessible:

    Wheelchair Ramp to front door: $400
    Wheelchair Ramp to back door: $400
    Widening entrance to front door: $600
    Chair lift on stairs: $3,000
    Walk-in bathtub: $4,500
    Decorative tile for walk-in bathtub: $1,000

She also had the following repair costs:

    Cost of repairing chair lift: $150
    Cost of repairing walk-in bathtub: $200

The improvements resulted in the following increases in value to her home:

    Ramps: $0
    Widening entrance to front door: $0
    Chair lift: $1,000
    Walk-in bathtub: $500
    Decorative tile in bathroom: $750

None of the expenses were covered by insurance. What is the amount of her qualifying medical expenses (before the consideration of any AGI limitations)?

    A. $8,900
    B. $7,650
    C. $7,750correct
    D. $7,400wrong

Study Unit 12: Standard Deduction and Itemized Deductions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 30% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

The total cost of the improvements is $8,900. The decorative tile is not a deductible expense. The deductible portion of home-related capital expenditures incurred by a handicapped individual must be further reduced by the increase in value to the existing qualifying property ($8,900 - $1,500 = $7,400). The repairs are also deductible ($7,400 + $350), so Dawn’s qualifying medical expenses would be $7,750 before figuring any AGI limitation. Based on an example in Publication 502, Medical and Dental Expenses.

Note: If Alexander had paid the expenses for himself, then Betty couldn't include his expenses on her separate return.  If they file a joint return, the medical expenses both paid during the year would be used to figure out their medical expense deduction for the year.
