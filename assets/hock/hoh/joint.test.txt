Test #2: Joint Return Test

If a married person files a joint return, that individual normally cannot be claimed as a dependent
by another taxpayer. Even if the other dependency tests are met, a taxpayer is generally not allowed
to claim a dependent if that person files a joint return with his or her spouse.

Example: Irina is 19 years old and had no income in 2023. Irina lived with her father for the whole
year. Irina got married on December 30, 2023, to Rafferty, who is 24 years old. Irina’s new husband
earned $28,700 during the year. Irina and Rafferty choose to file jointly. Irina’s father supported his
daughter the entire year and even paid for her wedding. However, her father cannot claim Irina as his
dependent because she is filing jointly with her new husband, Rafferty.

There is only one narrow exception to this test. The joint return test does not apply if the joint
return is filed by the dependent only to claim a refund, and neither spouse would have a tax liability,
even if they filed separate returns.

Example: Robbie and Rosalie are both 18 years old and recently married. They both live with Rosalie’s
mother, Sylvia. In 2023, Robbie earned $2,950 from a part-time job. That was the only income that
Robbie and his wife earned all year. Neither Robbie nor Rosalie is required to file a tax return, but they
decide to file a joint return to obtain a refund of the income taxes that were withheld from Robbie’s
wages. Robbie and Rosalie correctly check the box next to “Can anyone claim you as a dependent?” on
their joint tax return. As the exception to the joint return test applies, Sylvia can claim both Robbie and
Rosalie on her tax return, if all the other tests for dependency are met.
