    A. Mitchell has a short-term capital loss that must be reported on Schedule D.
    B. Mitchell cannot deduct any loss from the sale of his main home.correct
    C. Mitchell has a long-term capital loss that must be reported on Schedule D.
    D. Mitchell has a deductible casualty loss.wrong

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 72% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Mitchell has a loss on the sale of his primary residence, and since it is "personal-use" property, he cannot deduct it on his tax return. Losses from the sale of a main home are never tax-deductible.

3. Question ID: 94849606 (Topic: Sale of Personal Residence)

Tyler and Sophia are married and file jointly. They owned and lived in a house as their main home for 19 months. Sophia accepted a new job in another state, so they sold their home. What is the maximum amount of gain they can exclude from taxation under a reduced section 121 exclusion?

    A. $395,833correct
    B. $197,916
    C. $295,600
    D. $500,000wrong

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 67% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Tyler and Sophia are eligible for a “reduced exclusion”, even though they did not live in the home for two full years. The maximum amount of their reduced exclusion is $395,833 ($500,000 x [19 months/24 months]). A taxpayer who owned and used a home for less than two years (and therefore does not meet the ownership and use tests) or who has used the home sale exclusion within the prior two-year period may be able to claim a reduced exclusion under certain conditions. This may apply if a home sale has occurred primarily because of “unforeseen circumstances” during the taxpayer’s period of use and ownership. Unforeseen circumstances include the following:

    Death, divorce, or legal separation.
    Certain health reasons related to care for the taxpayer, a spouse, a child, or certain other related persons.
    Unemployment or a job change if a new job is at least 50 miles farther from the old home than was the former place of employment.
    Multiple births resulting from the same pregnancy.
    Damage to the residence resulting from a disaster, an act of war, or terrorism.
    Involuntary conversion of the property.

The “unforeseen circumstances” may involve the taxpayer, his spouse, a co-owner, or a member of the taxpayer’s household (i.e., it does not have to be a dependent or a taxpayer named on the return).

4. Question ID: 94849614 (Topic: Sale of Personal Residence)

Stephanie and Roger, a married couple, purchased a home together seven years ago for $180,000. They both lived in it until January 12, 2023, when they legally separated, and Roger moved out. The court granted Stephanie sole ownership of the home as part of their divorce settlement. Their divorce became final on September 1, 2023. The fair market value of the home was $442,000 when ownership was transferred to Stephanie. She sold the house on December 26, 2023, for $451,000. What is Stephanie’s taxable gain on this transaction?

    A. $21,000correct
    B. $0
    C. $9,000
    D. $271,000wrong

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 46% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Special rules apply to divorced taxpayers. Stephanie meets the "ownership and use" tests, and the basis in the property remains the same. Transfers related to a divorce are generally nontaxable, and the fair market value of the property at the time of the divorce has no bearing on the taxable outcome. The gain is figured as follows:

    Original cost: $180,000
    Sale price: $451,000
    Total realized gain: $271,000
    Sec. 121 exclusion for single filers: ($250,000)
    Taxable gain she must report on her tax return: $21,000 in long-term capital gains

Since she owned the property for longer than one year, the taxable portion of Stephanie’s gain would be reported as a long-term capital gain. Because she is no longer legally married in the year of the sale, she will be filing single, and her maximum section 121 exclusion is $250,000, not $500,000.

5. Question ID: 94849612 (Topic: Sale of Personal Residence)

Nicklaus is single. He sold his main residence in California and moved to Washington. He had purchased the house over fifteen years ago for $330,000, and he sold it for $673,000 net of selling expenses. During the time he lived in the house, he paid $45,000 for capital improvements (to add an extra bedroom) and $18,000 for general repairs and $1,200 for gardening supplies. Assuming that Nicklaus utilizes the maximum available exclusion, what amount would he report as taxable gain?

    A. $48,000correct
    B. $93,000
    C. $0
    D. $30,000wrong

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 72% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Nicklaus’s adjusted basis in the house would be the total of his original purchase price of $330,000 plus the $45,000 cost of improvements (basis of $375,000). The cost of general repairs or gardening supplies would not be considered in determining his adjusted basis. Therefore, his gain on the sale would be $298,000, or the excess of his net proceeds over his adjusted basis ($673,000 – $375,000 = $298,000). Since he met the requirements for ownership and use of the house as his main home, he qualifies for the maximum section 121 exclusion of $250,000 available to a single taxpayer, and the taxable portion of his gain would be $48,000.

6. Question ID: 94850123 (Topic: Sale of Personal Residence)

Samuel is unmarried. He sold his home for $275,000. His selling expenses were $10,000. He purchased the home seven years ago for $125,000, he has lived in it as his main home. He qualifies for the Section 121 exclusion. How much gain may he exclude from tax on this sale?

    A. $250,000
    B. $150,000
    C. $140,000correct
    D. $125,000wrong

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 57% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Samuel can exclude all the gain, or $140,000, from tax under Section 121. The gain is figured as follows: ($275,000 sales price - $125,000 basis - $10,000 closing costs). None of the gain on the sale is taxable, because it is under the Section 121 exclusion amount for single filers. The law permits a maximum gain exclusion of $250,000 ($500,000 MFJ). See IRS Topic 701, Sale of a Main Home, for more references and information. 

8. Question ID: 94849616 (Topic: Sale of Personal Residence)

Elaine and Chandler are married and file jointly. They owned and lived in a home as their primary residence for 18 years. They purchased it for $119,000 and sold it for $703,000 on March 1 of the taxable year. Also during the year, the couple sold a vacation home for $433,000. They had purchased the vacation home five years ago for $459,000. What amounts of taxable gain (or loss) result from both of these transactions?

    A. $84,000 capital gain.correct
    B. $26,000 capital gain.
    C. $84,000 capital gain; $3,000 ordinary loss.
    D. $584,000 capital gain.wrong

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 53% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Under the section 121 exclusion, Elaine and Chandler can exclude up to $500,000 of the gain on their primary residence, so they must recognize $84,000 of long-term capital gain ($703,000 - $119,000 = $584,000). The exclusion may be claimed only on a main home and not on a second home, and is subject to both ownership and occupancy tests. A loss on a personal residence, regardless of whether it is a main home or a second home, is not deductible. The loss on the vacation home is therefore not deductible and cannot offset the gain on the sale of the primary residence.

9. Question ID: 97433535 (Topic: Sale of Personal Residence)

John and Penny are married and file jointly. They owned and used their house as their main home for 15 months. John got transferred to another state, and they were forced to move and sell their home. They have a $400,000 gain on the sale. What is the maximum amount of gain they can exclude from income under the rules regarding a reduced exclusion?

    A. 312,500correct
    B. 400,000
    C. 65,500
    D. 215,000wrong

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 63% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

John and Penny can exclude up to $312,500 in gain from the sale. A reduced exclusion is available, even though they did not live in the home for two full years. They qualify for a reduced exclusion because they are moving for a change in John's employment. Their maximum reduced exclusion is $312,500 ($500,000 × [15 months/24 months]). This would be the maximum that they could exclude on the sale. The reduced exclusion applies when the premature sale is primarily due to a move for employment in a new location.

11. Question ID: 94849613 (Topic: Sale of Personal Residence)

Ophelia bought her principal residence in California for $250,000 on January 3, 2023. She sold it on December 23, 2023, (less than 12 months later) for $276,000 because she wanted to move in with her boyfriend. She also paid $14,000 in mortgage interest during the year. What is the amount and character of her gain on the sale?

    A. Long-term capital gain of $12,000.
    B. Short-term ordinary gain of $25,000.
    C. Short-term capital gain of $26,000.correct
    D. $0 gain or loss, she qualifies for the Section 121 exclusion.wrong

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 82% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Ophelia did not own the home for more than one year, so the gain is reported as a short-term capital gain ($250,000 - $276,000 = $26,000 gain). She would start counting her holding period on the day after the date of purchase. She cannot exclude any of the gain under section 121 because she did not meet the “ownership” and “use” tests. During the five-year period ending on the date of the sale, Ophelia must have owned the home for at least two years and lived in it as her main home for at least two years. The two-year period does not need to be continuous. In order to qualify for the exclusion, the taxpayer must not have excluded gain on the sale of another home during the previous two years. She also does not qualify for a “reduced exclusion”, because moving in with her boyfriend is not one of the circumstances that would allow her to qualify for a reduced exclusion.

12. Question ID: 94849638 (Topic: Sale of Personal Residence)

For the past six years, Claire lived with her parents in the home her parents owned. On February 1, 2023, she purchased her childhood home from her parents, and her parents moved out to live in another state. She continued to live in the home until December 1, 2023, when she sold the house because her job was transferred to another state. Does she meet the requirements for the Section 121 exclusion?

    A. No, because she did not own the house for at least two years.
    B. No, she does not meet both the ownership and use tests.
    C. She qualifies for a partial exclusion under Section 121.correct
    D. She qualifies for a full Section 121 exclusion of $250,000.wrong

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 49% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Although she did not own it for the required two years, she qualifies for a “partial exclusion” on her gain, because a job transfer is a qualified reason for a partial exclusion. A taxpayer who owned and used a home for less than two years may be able to claim a reduced exclusion under certain conditions. This may apply if a home sale has occurred primarily because of “unforeseen circumstances” during the taxpayer’s period of use and ownership.

"Unforeseen circumstances" include the following safe harbor exceptions: death, divorce, or legal separation; certain health reasons; unemployment or a job change; multiple births resulting from the same pregnancy; damage to the residence resulting from a disaster, an act of war, or terrorism; or involuntary conversion of the property. See IRS Topic 701, Sale of a Main Home, for more references and information.

7. Question ID: 95400234 (Topic: Sale of Personal Residence)

Joyce bought her home three years ago. She got behind on her mortgage payments and the bank foreclosed on the home on January 10, 2023. All of the debt was incurred to purchase the home, and the home was her primary residence. She received Form 1099-C for the amount of mortgage debt that was canceled by the bank. She was not insolvent nor in bankruptcy at the time of the foreclosure. How should this transaction be reported on her tax return?

    A. Her tax return should include Schedule B, to show the basis of the home disposed of through foreclosure.
    B. Her tax return should include the cancelled debt on Schedule D. All the cancelled debt is taxable. 
    C. Her tax return should include the cancelled debt as "other income" on Form 1040. 
    D. Her tax return should include Form 8949 and Schedule D to show the basis of the home disposed of through foreclosure, and Form 982 to exclude the debt cancellation from income. correct

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 59% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

All of her debt is "qualified principal residence indebtedness," so it's not taxable, (even if she is not insolvent or in bankruptcy) but it still must be reported on her return. Her tax return should include Form 8949 and Schedule D to show the basis of the home disposed of through foreclosure, and Form 982 to exclude the debt cancellation from income. See IRS Topic No. 431 Canceled Debt for information. 

Note: The Mortgage Debt Relief Act (2007-2020) was the first bill to apply this provision. The exclusion from debt for principal residence indebtedness was further extended through tax year 2025 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act in December of 2020.

10. Question ID: 94849554 (Topic: Sale of Personal Residence)

Keith purchased his home seven years ago for $175,000. This year, he added another bedroom and a sunroom to the property at a cost of $28,000. He also repaired two broken windows at a cost of $650. His basis in the home is now:

    A. $28,000.
    B. $175,000.
    C. $203,650.
    D. $203,000.correct

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 82% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Keith's adjusted basis in the home is $203,000, the combined amount of his original basis plus the value of the new additions to the house. The cost of the repairs are not added to basis, because repairs do not “materially increase the value” or “substantially prolong the useful life” of the home.
