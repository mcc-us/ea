CHILD TAX CREDIT

The Child Tax Credit (CTC) is totally separate from the Child and
Dependent Care Credit. Do not confuse these two credits!

The nonrefundable is $2,000 per qualifying child

The refundable is a maximum of $1,600
per qualifying child in 2023

The AGI phaseout for the Child Tax Credit is $200,000 ($400,000 for
joint filers). If income exceeds the limit, the credit will decrease by
$50 for every $1,000 that the AGI exceeds the limit.

The child must have a valid Social Security number to qualify for
the Child Tax Credit. ITINs and ATINs are not sufficient.

Taxpayers with income below certain threshold amounts can
Slam he Child Tax Credit for each qualifying child under the age
of 17

Unlike the Earned Income Tax Credit, disability has no effect on the

eligibility for this credit. The child's age is the primary determining
factor.
