In some cases, a late-filed tax return and claiming a tax refund beyond
deadline will be honored. The IRS will consider many sound reasons with
reasonable cause for Jaling to file a tax return, make a deposit, or pay tax
when due. Sound reasons, if established, include:

Fire, casualty, natural disaster or other disturbances
Inability to obtain records

Death, serious illness, incapacitation or unavoidable absence of the taxpayer or a
member of the taxpayer's immediate family

Several unique scenarios allow a taxpayer to request a refund beyond the
“normal” deadline. These unique scenarios involve:

A bad debt from worthless securities (up to seven years prior)

A payment or accrual of foreign tax (up to ten years prior)

A net operating loss carryback

A carryback of certain tax credits

Exceptions for military personnel

Taxpayers in federally declared disaster areas

Taxpayers who have been affected by a terroristic or military action
