Test #1: Dependent Taxpayer Test

A person who may be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer, may not claim anyone as a
dependent on his or her own tax return. In other words, the dependent taxpayer test specifies that any
taxpayer who can be claimed as a dependent cannot claim a dependent themselves.

Example: Evie is an 18-year-old single mother who has an infant son who is three months old. Evie
and her son live with her parents. Evie has a small part-time job, but she only earned $2,300. She does
not make enough money to support herself or her infant son. Evie is claimed as a dependent by her
parents, so she is prohibited from claiming her infant son as a dependent on her own tax return.

Sometimes, an individual meets the rules to be a qualifying dependent of more than one person.
Regardless, only one person can claim the same individual as a dependent.
