Barnes pays $300 a year for membership in a university's athletic scholarship program, which is a qualified charitable organization. The only benefit of membership is that he has the right to buy one season ticket for a seat in a designated area of the stadium at the university's home football games. He doesn't actually purchase any football tickets or go to any games. How much of this is a qualified charitable contribution?

    A. He can deduct $300 as a charitable contribution.
    B. He can only deduct 50% as a charitable contribution ($150).
    C. He cannot deduct a charitable contribution.correct
    D. He can deduct $240 (80% of $300) as a charitable contribution.wrong

This is considered a "quid pro quo" contribution. A quid pro quo contribution is a charitable donation for which the donor receives something from the recipient in exchange for their funds. The fact that Barnes didn't take advantage of the perk and purchase any football tickets is irrelevant.  For more information, see Publication 526, Charitable Contributions.

Harriet’s AGI is $50,000. She gave her church $2,000 cash and 300 shares of appreciated Ford Motors stock with a fair market value of $28,000 and a basis of $22,000. She had held the stock for ten years before deciding to donate it to her church. She plans to itemize this year. What is her allowable deduction for charitable gifts on Schedule A for 2023?

    A. $17,000correct
    B. $30,000
    C. $25,000
    D. $24,000wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Harriet’s deduction is limited to $17,000 ($2,000 + $15,000).

The $2,000 cash donated to the church is fully deductible. However, the contribution of appreciated property (the stock) is subject to a 30%-of-AGI limit. Therefore, Harriet’s deduction for the appreciated stock is limited to $15,000 (30% limitation × $50,000 AGI). The unused part of the gift ($13,000) can be carried over to future tax years (for up to five years). Charitable contribution carryovers are typically limited to five years, except for qualified conservation easement contributions, which have a carryover period of 15 years.

Michael makes several charitable donations during the year. Which of the following donations does NOT meet the IRS’s recordkeeping requirements?

    A. A $300 donation to a local church. Michael has a canceled check for the donation but no receipt.correct
    B. A $600 donation of a car to a local charity. Michael has a Form 1098-C for the donation.
    C. A $100 donation of clothing to Goodwill. Michael has a receipt for the donation.
    D. A $240 donation to an animal shelter. Michael has a canceled check for the donation, but no receipt.wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for A:

The $300 donation to his local church does not meet all the substantiation requirements. Michael has a canceled check for the donation, but no receipt, and the donation amount is OVER $250.

For any single contribution of $250 or more (including contributions of cash or property), a canceled check or receipt alone is insufficient. The taxpayer must also obtain and keep in his records a contemporaneous written acknowledgment from the qualified organization indicating the amount of the cash and a description of any property contributed. The acknowledgment must say whether the organization provided any goods or services in exchange for the gift and, if so, must provide a description and a good faith estimate of the value of those goods or services.

    A. $9,000
    B. $2,900correct
    C. $4,000
    D. $500, unless he has a qualified appraisal.wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for B:

If Wilford itemizes his deductions, he can deduct $2,900 for his donation, because that was the value that was reported on Form 1098-C. Special rules apply to the donation of vehicles. The charitable organization must file a Form 1098-C, Contributions of Motor Vehicles, Boats, and Airplanes, with the IRS for each contribution of a qualified vehicle that has a claimed value of more than $500. For more information, see Publication 526,Charitable Contributions.

Denise, age 77, and Gary, age 78, are married and file jointly. Because of their age, they are both required to take an IRA distribution this year. Instead of taking their required RMDs, they would like to use money from their traditional IRA accounts to donate directly to their favorite church. Between the two of them, what is the maximum amount they could withdraw from their IRA as a “qualified charitable distribution” in 2023?

    A. $200,000correct
    B. $10,000
    C. $100,000
    D. $50,000wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for A:

They can donate up to $200,000 as a married couple directly from their IRA accounts. A "Qualified Charitable Contribution" or QCD, is when a taxpayer who is at least age 70½ directs his or her IRA trustee to make a distribution directly to a public charity. The maximum per year is $100,000 each ($200,000 for MFJ taxpayers). The QCD is not included in the income of the IRA owner, and the owner doesn’t receive a charitable contribution deduction.

The IRA trustee must make the distribution directly to the qualified charity (in other words, the taxpayer cannot request a distribution and then donate the money later; the trustee has to make the contribution to the charity directly).

Note: The SECURE Act increased the age at which individuals must start taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) to 73 in 2023. However, the SECURE Act did NOT change the age at which taxpayers can make a QCD (that is still 70½). For more information on Retirement Distributions, see Publication 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements.

Last year, Jacob's 22 year old niece, Mary, was his dependent. In 2023, she no longer qualifies as his dependent because she is no longer a student and she earned $6,000 in wages, so she does not meet the gross income test to be claimed as a qualifying relative. However, Jacob paid $1,800 this year for medical expenses Mary incurred last year when she was his dependent. Which of the following statements is true?

    A. Jacob can include the $1,800 in figuring this year's medical expense deduction on his Schedule A.correct
    B. Jacob can claim the $1,800 as an adjustment to income on his own return.
    C. Jacob cannot include his niece's medical expenses on his own tax return.
    D. Since she is not Jacob's dependent, Mary is the only one who can claim the $1,800 in medical expenses on her own return.wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Jacob can include the $1,800 in figuring this year's medical expense deduction on his Schedule A. According to IRS Publication 502, "a taxpayer can deduct medical expenses you pay for yourself, as well as those you pay for someone who was your spouse or your dependent either when the services were provided or when you paid for them."

Dawn has multiple sclerosis and is in a wheelchair. She owns her home. During the current year, she paid the following amounts for improvements to her home to make it accessible:

    Wheelchair Ramp to front door: $400

    Chair lift on stairs: $3,000

    Decorative tile for walk-in bathtub: $1,000

She also had the following repair costs:

    Cost of repairing chair lift: $150
    Cost of repairing walk-in bathtub: $200

The improvements resulted in the following increases in value to her home:

    Ramps: $0
    Widening entrance to front door: $0
    Chair lift: $1,000
    Walk-in bathtub: $500
    Decorative tile in bathroom: $750

None of the expenses were covered by insurance. What is the amount of her qualifying medical expenses (before the consideration of any AGI limitations)?

    A. $8,900
    B. $7,650
    C. $7,750correct
    D. $7,400wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for C:

The total cost of the improvements is $8,900. The decorative tile is not a deductible expense. The deductible portion of home-related capital expenditures incurred by a handicapped individual must be further reduced by the increase in value to the existing qualifying property ($8,900 - $1,500 = $7,400). The repairs are also deductible ($7,400 + $350), so Dawn’s qualifying medical expenses would be $7,750 before figuring any AGI limitation. Based on an example in Publication 502, Medical and Dental Expenses.

    B. The medical expenses are not deductible by either spouse. 
    C. The medical expenses paid for Louise are only deductible on Louise's final Form 1040. 
    D. The medical expenses are only deductible by Andrew if he files a joint return with his late wife (Louise). wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Because Andrew was married to Louise when she received the medical services, he can include those expenses in figuring his medical expense deduction for the year. Andrew cannot file a joint return with his late wife because he remarried in the same year. He may file a joint return with his NEW wife, which in turn, means that Louise's final tax return must be filed as MFS. However, since Andrew was married to Louise when she incurred the medical expenses, and since he paid for the medical expenses, he is allowed to deduct them on his return, regardless of whether he files a joint return or a separate return.

    B. They will have to file jointly.
    C. Willard cannot itemize his casualty losses if he files MFS.

Barnes pays $300 a year for membership in a university's athletic scholarship program, which is a qualified charitable organization. The only benefit of membership is that he has the right to buy one season ticket for a seat in a designated area of the stadium at the university's home football games. He doesn't actually purchase any football tickets or go to any games. How much of this is a qualified charitable contribution?

    A. He can deduct $300 as a charitable contribution.

    C. He cannot deduct a charitable contribution.correct

Harriet’s AGI is $50,000. She gave her church $2,000 cash and 300 shares of appreciated Ford Motors stock with a fair market value of $28,000 and a basis of $22,000. She had held the stock for ten years before deciding to donate it to her church. She plans to itemize this year. What is her allowable deduction for charitable gifts on Schedule A for 2023?

    A. $17,000correct
    B. $30,000

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Harriet’s deduction is limited to $17,000 ($2,000 + $15,000).

The $2,000 cash donated to the church is fully deductible. However, the contribution of appreciated property (the stock) is subject to a 30%-of-AGI limit. Therefore, Harriet’s deduction for the appreciated stock is limited to $15,000 (30% limitation × $50,000 AGI). The unused part of the gift ($13,000) can be carried over to future tax years (for up to five years). Charitable contribution carryovers are typically limited to five years, except for qualified conservation easement contributions, which have a carryover period of 15 years.

Michael makes several charitable donations during the year. Which of the following donations does NOT meet the IRS’s recordkeeping requirements?

    A. A $300 donation to a local church. Michael has a canceled check for the donation but no receipt.correct
    B. A $600 donation of a car to a local charity. Michael has a Form 1098-C for the donation.
    C. A $100 donation of clothing to Goodwill. Michael has a receipt for the donation.
    D. A $240 donation to an animal shelter. Michael has a canceled check for the donation, but no receipt.wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for A:

The $300 donation to his local church does not meet all the substantiation requirements. Michael has a canceled check for the donation, but no receipt, and the donation amount is OVER $250.

For any single contribution of $250 or more (including contributions of cash or property), a canceled check or receipt alone is insufficient. The taxpayer must also obtain and keep in his records a contemporaneous written acknowledgment from the qualified organization indicating the amount of the cash and a description of any property contributed. The acknowledgment must say whether the organization provided any goods or services in exchange for the gift and, if so, must provide a description and a good faith estimate of the value of those goods or services.

    A. $9,000
    B. $2,900correct
    C. $4,000
    D. $500, unless he has a qualified appraisal.wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for B:

If Wilford itemizes his deductions, he can deduct $2,900 for his donation, because that was the value that was reported on Form 1098-C. Special rules apply to the donation of vehicles. The charitable organization must file a Form 1098-C, Contributions of Motor Vehicles, Boats, and Airplanes, with the IRS for each contribution of a qualified vehicle that has a claimed value of more than $500. For more information, see Publication 526,Charitable Contributions.

Denise, age 77, and Gary, age 78, are married and file jointly. Because of their age, they are both required to take an IRA distribution this year. Instead of taking their required RMDs, they would like to use money from their traditional IRA accounts to donate directly to their favorite church. Between the two of them, what is the maximum amount they could withdraw from their IRA as a “qualified charitable distribution” in 2023?

    A. $200,000correct
    B. $10,000
    C. $100,000
    D. $50,000wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for A:

They can donate up to $200,000 as a married couple directly from their IRA accounts. A "Qualified Charitable Contribution" or QCD, is when a taxpayer who is at least age 70½ directs his or her IRA trustee to make a distribution directly to a public charity. The maximum per year is $100,000 each ($200,000 for MFJ taxpayers). The QCD is not included in the income of the IRA owner, and the owner doesn’t receive a charitable contribution deduction.

The IRA trustee must make the distribution directly to the qualified charity (in other words, the taxpayer cannot request a distribution and then donate the money later; the trustee has to make the contribution to the charity directly).

Note: The SECURE Act increased the age at which individuals must start taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) to 73 in 2023. However, the SECURE Act did NOT change the age at which taxpayers can make a QCD (that is still 70½). For more information on Retirement Distributions, see Publication 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements.

Elena paid the following costs during the year:

    $15,000 of mortgage interest and $2,000 property taxes on her primary residence.
    $9,900 of mortgage interest on her vacation home in Hawaii
    $6,700 of loan interest on a cabin in Lake Tahoe that she uses occasionally when she wants to visit her family.

None of the homes are rentals. She is single and her AGI is $90,000. What is Selena’s maximum mortgage interest deduction on Schedule A?

    A. $33,600
    B. $24,900correct
    C. $31,600
    D. $15,000wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for B:

A taxpayer can deduct the mortgage interest on up to two personal homes. Therefore, Elena should claim the mortgage interest on her primary residence and her second home, since it gives her a larger deduction ($15,000 + $9,900 = $24,900). A taxpayer cannot deduct mortgage interest for more than two homes, so the interest she pays on the third home would not be deductible. The property taxes of $2,000 would be deductible, but not as mortgage interest.

Last year, Jacob's 22 year old niece, Mary, was his dependent. In 2023, she no longer qualifies as his dependent because she is no longer a student and she earned $6,000 in wages, so she does not meet the gross income test to be claimed as a qualifying relative. However, Jacob paid $1,800 this year for medical expenses Mary incurred last year when she was his dependent. Which of the following statements is true?

    A. Jacob can include the $1,800 in figuring this year's medical expense deduction on his Schedule A.correct
    B. Jacob can claim the $1,800 as an adjustment to income on his own return.
    C. Jacob cannot include his niece's medical expenses on his own tax return.
    D. Since she is not Jacob's dependent, Mary is the only one who can claim the $1,800 in medical expenses on her own return.wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Jacob can include the $1,800 in figuring this year's medical expense deduction on his Schedule A. According to IRS Publication 502, "a taxpayer can deduct medical expenses you pay for yourself, as well as those you pay for someone who was your spouse or your dependent either when the services were provided or when you paid for them." Since Mary was Jacob's dependent when the services were provided, the amounts are deductible by Jacob if he is the one who paid them. (This question is based on a prior EA exam question).

Dawn has multiple sclerosis and is in a wheelchair. She owns her home. During the current year, she paid the following amounts for improvements to her home to make it accessible:

    Wheelchair Ramp to front door: $400

The improvements resulted in the following increases in value to her home:

    Ramps: $0
    Widening entrance to front door: $0
    Chair lift: $1,000
    Walk-in bathtub: $500
    Decorative tile in bathroom: $750

None of the expenses were covered by insurance. What is the amount of her qualifying medical expenses (before the consideration of any AGI limitations)?

    A. $8,900
    B. $7,650
    C. $7,750correct
    D. $7,400wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for C:

The total cost of the improvements is $8,900. The decorative tile is not a deductible expense. The deductible portion of home-related capital expenditures incurred by a handicapped individual must be further reduced by the increase in value to the existing qualifying property ($8,900 - $1,500 = $7,400). The repairs are also deductible ($7,400 + $350), so Dawn’s qualifying medical expenses would be $7,750 before figuring any AGI limitation.

In 2023, the additional Standard Deduction for Age 65 and Over and/or Blindness is $1,850 for single filers. So his standard deduction would be $13,850 + $1,850 + $1,850 = $17,550.

    C. Theft of personal jewelry from a home robbery.
    D. A casualty loss suffered in a federal disaster area.correct



Correct Answer Explanation for D:

A casualty loss suffered in a federal disaster area would be deductible. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the deduction for personal casualty losses, with the exception of casualty losses suffered in a federal disaster area.

Note: Casualty losses on business or rental property are still fully deductible, regardless of whether the losses occur in a federal disaster area or not, but theft and casualty losses of business property do not get reported on Schedule A.

Barnes pays $300 a year for membership in a university's athletic scholarship program, which is a qualified charitable organization. The only benefit of membership is that he has the right to buy one season ticket for a seat in a designated area of the stadium at the university's home football games. He doesn't actually purchase any football tickets or go to any games. How much of this is a qualified charitable contribution?

    A. He can deduct $300 as a charitable contribution.
    B. He can only deduct 50% as a charitable contribution ($150).
    C. He cannot deduct a charitable contribution.correct
    D. He can deduct $240 (80% of $300) as a charitable contribution.wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, no deduction is allowed for any amount paid for the right to purchase tickets for seating at an athletic event in a college athletic stadium. This is considered a "quid pro quo" contribution. A quid pro quo contribution is a charitable donation for which the donor receives something from the recipient in exchange for their funds. The fact that Barnes didn't take advantage of the perk and purchase any football tickets is irrelevant.  For more information, see Publication 526, Charitable Contributions.

Harriet’s AGI is $50,000. She gave her church $2,000 cash and 300 shares of appreciated Ford Motors stock with a fair market value of $28,000 and a basis of $22,000. She had held the stock for ten years before deciding to donate it to her church. She plans to itemize this year. What is her allowable deduction for charitable gifts on Schedule A for 2023?

    A. $17,000correct
    B. $30,000
    C. $25,000
    D. $24,000wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Harriet’s deduction is limited to $17,000 ($2,000 + $15,000).

The $2,000 cash donated to the church is fully deductible. However, the contribution of appreciated property (the stock) is subject to a 30%-of-AGI limit. Therefore, Harriet’s deduction for the appreciated stock is limited to $15,000 (30% limitation × $50,000 AGI). The unused part of the gift ($13,000) can be carried over to future tax years (for up to five years). Charitable contribution carryovers are typically limited to five years, except for qualified conservation easement contributions, which have a carryover period of 15 years.

Michael makes several charitable donations during the year. Which of the following donations does NOT meet the IRS’s recordkeeping requirements?

    A. A $300 donation to a local church. Michael has a canceled check for the donation but no receipt.correct
    B. A $600 donation of a car to a local charity. Michael has a Form 1098-C for the donation.
    C. A $100 donation of clothing to Goodwill. Michael has a receipt for the donation.
    D. A $240 donation to an animal shelter. Michael has a canceled check for the donation, but no receipt.wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for A:

The $300 donation to his local church does not meet all the substantiation requirements. Michael has a canceled check for the donation, but no receipt, and the donation amount is OVER $250.

For any single contribution of $250 or more (including contributions of cash or property), a canceled check or receipt alone is insufficient. The taxpayer must also obtain and keep in his records a contemporaneous written acknowledgment from the qualified organization indicating the amount of the cash and a description of any property contributed. The acknowledgment must say whether the organization provided any goods or services in exchange for the gift and, if so, must provide a description and a good faith estimate of the value of those goods or services.

    B. $2,900correct
    C. $4,000
    D. $500, unless he has a qualified appraisal.wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for B:

If Wilford itemizes his deductions, he can deduct $2,900 for his donation, because that was the value that was reported on Form 1098-C. Special rules apply to the donation of vehicles. The charitable organization must file a Form 1098-C, Contributions of Motor Vehicles, Boats, and Airplanes, with the IRS for each contribution of a qualified vehicle that has a claimed value of more than $500.

    B. $600
    C. $300
    D. $200wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Denise, age 77, and Gary, age 78, are married and file jointly. Because of their age, they are both required to take an IRA distribution this year. Instead of taking their required RMDs, they would like to use money from their traditional IRA accounts to donate directly to their favorite church. Between the two of them, what is the maximum amount they could withdraw from their IRA as a “qualified charitable distribution” in 2023?

    A. $200,000correct
    B. $10,000
    C. $100,000
    D. $50,000wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for A:

They can donate up to $200,000 as a married couple directly from their IRA accounts. A "Qualified Charitable Contribution" or QCD, is when a taxpayer who is at least age 70½ directs his or her IRA trustee to make a distribution directly to a public charity. The maximum per year is $100,000 each ($200,000 for MFJ taxpayers). The QCD is not included in the income of the IRA owner, and the owner doesn’t receive a charitable contribution deduction.

The IRA trustee must make the distribution directly to the qualified charity (in other words, the taxpayer cannot request a distribution and then donate the money later; the trustee has to make the contribution to the charity directly).

Note: The SECURE Act increased the age at which individuals must start taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) to 73 in 2023. However, the SECURE Act did NOT change the age at which taxpayers can make a QCD (that is still 70½). For more information on Retirement Distributions, see Publication 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements.

Last year, Jacob's 22 year old niece, Mary, was his dependent. In 2023, she no longer qualifies as his dependent because she is no longer a student and she earned $6,000 in wages, so she does not meet the gross income test to be claimed as a qualifying relative.

The improvements resulted in the following increases in value to her home:

    Ramps: $0
    Widening entrance to front door: $0
    Chair lift: $1,000
    Walk-in bathtub: $500
    Decorative tile in bathroom: $750

    A. $8,900
    B. $7,650
    C. $7,750correct
    D. $7,400wrong



Correct Answer Explanation for C:

The total cost of the improvements is $8,900. The decorative tile is not a deductible expense. The deductible portion of home-related capital expenditures incurred by a handicapped individual must be further reduced by the increase in value to the existing qualifying property ($8,900 - $1,500 = $7,400). The repairs are also deductible ($7,400 + $350), so Dawn’s qualifying medical expenses would be $7,750 before figuring any AGI limitation.

    Meals with clients: $500.
    Home office expenses: $1,100.

Of Galilea's deductions, only gambling losses are deductible, and then, the deduction is limited to the amount of her gambling winnings ($2,000). None of her work-related expenses would be deductible.

Note: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act suspended a large number of miscellaneous deductions lumped together in a category called “miscellaneous itemized deductions” that were deductible to the extent they exceeded 2% of a taxpayer's AGI. One of these was the deduction for employee business expenses (for most employees, although there are some narrow exceptions). Some miscellaneous itemized deductions are still allowable, however, including the deduction for gambling losses (but only to the extent of gambling winnings).
