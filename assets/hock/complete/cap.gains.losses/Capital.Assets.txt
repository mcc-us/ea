    A. A taxpayer engaged in the trade or business of selling securities.correct
    B. A taxpayer who reports income and loss on Schedule E.
    C. A taxpayer who engages in the business of professional gambling.

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 93% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

IRC Sec. 475 defines a "securities dealer" or "stockbroker", as a taxpayer who regularly purchases and sells securities (such as stocks and bonds) in the ordinary course of a trade or business. A stockbroker is unique; unlike other taxpayers who purchase and sell securities, a securities dealer is a taxpayer engaged in the trade or business of selling securities. Because a securities dealer holds securities for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, such securities are not considered capital assets; therefore, the gain or loss is treated as ordinary gain or loss, NOT a capital gain or loss. A self-employed securities dealer must make a special election called the "Mark-to-Market" election, and then report their income or loss on Schedule C (not Schedule D). The IRS discusses Securities Dealers in Tax Topic 429, Traders in Securities.
