D. $4,200 long-term capital gain.correct

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 79% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

A stock dividend does not increase basis. Instead, the original basis of the stock is spread over the additional shares. Stock acquired in a stock dividend or stock split has the same holding period as the original stock owned. Since Malila's original stock has a long-term holding period, the stock she received in a stock dividend also has a long-term holding period and all of her gain is long-term. The answer is calculated as follows:

300 shares × $4 per share = $1,200 (taxpayer’s basis before stock dividend)
600 shares × $2 per share = $1,200 (taxpayer’s basis after stock dividend)
600 shares × $9 per share = $5,400 (gross sale price)
$5,400 - $1,200 = $4,200 long-term capital gain

B. This loss should be reported as a bad debt deduction on Schedule A.
C. She cannot take a capital loss until she sells the stock to an unrelated buyer.
D. This loss should be reported as a casualty loss. She can take the entire $5,500 loss in the current year. 

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 71% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Jenny should report the loss as a capital loss; the loss would be limited to $3,000 in the current year, and she can carryover the unused loss indefinitely. If a taxpayer owns stock that becomes totally worthless, this would be reported as a capital loss on Schedule D. The stock does not have to be sold if the stock is truly worthless, because worthless securities have no market value. See more about the rules for worthless securities.

6. Question ID: 94849604 (Topic: Capital Gains and Losses)

Larry bought 140 shares of stock from his sister, Ezra, for $7,600. Her original cost basis on the stock was $10,000. Larry sold all the shares two years later through a stockbroker for $11,500. What is his recognized gain on the sale?

A. $6,100 gain.
B. $3,900 gain.
C. $1,500 gain.correct
D. $2,400 gain.

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 57% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

The sale between Larry and his sister is a related-party transaction, and is therefore subject to special rules. If, in a purchase or exchange, a taxpayer received property from a related person who had a loss that was not allowable and the taxpayer later sells the property at a gain, the taxpayer will recognize the gain only to the extent it is more than the loss previously disallowed to the related person. Although Ezra lost $2,400 in the original sale to her brother, the loss was not deductible. When Larry later sold the same stock to an unrelated party for $11,500, he realized a gain of $3,900. However, the recognized gain is only $1,500 (the portion of the gain that is more than the $2,400 loss not allowed to his sister).
