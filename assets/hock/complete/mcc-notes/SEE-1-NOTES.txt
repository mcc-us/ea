;;Common Tax Forms: 1040, -NR(non-resident), -SR(senior), -X (amendment), -ES (estimated)
;;[Uncommon: -PR(Puerto Rico), -GUAM, etc.]
;;Mailbox Rule: The USPS post mark determines if a filing (or payment) is on time or not. Can use DHL, UPS, FEDEX in some cases.
;;USE CERTIFIED MAIL, For crucial work/timing, bc you need proof you sent it!
;;If you think it will be close just file Extensions to be safe, Ext = f4868
;;Extensions f4868 is for individuals
;;Fisherman/ Farmers: two-thirds of income must be from the two, to have March 1st or Jan 15th deadline, Required Annual Payment, F&F do not pay have to pay estimated tax

;;US citizens living outside US have 2 month ext, BUT it is BETTER to file f4868.
;;SEE: www.TaxpayerAdvocate.irs.gov/2023PurpleBook

8. Estimate taxes & Penalties
;;taxes operates on a “pay-as-you-go” basis
;;Individuals, sole proprietors, partners & S-corp shareholders make estimated tax payments if:
;;;they expect to owe at least $1,000
;;;they owed tax in the prior year.
;;Taxpayers need to make estimated tax payments IF
;;;receives income from interest, dividends, alimony, capital gains, prizes & awards,
;;;salary, pension or it’s not enough,
;;;has more than one job but doesn’t have each employer withhold taxes,
;;;is self-employed,
;;;is a representative of a direct-sales or in-home-sales company.
;;Form 2210, Underestimate of estimated tax requests a waiver of penalty
;;When to pay: April 15, June 15, Sept. 15, Jan. 15
;;Penalties – 4 Types,
;;;Failure to file,
;;;to pay,
;;;to pay estimated,
;;;to pay interest
;;Failure to file: most severe, 5% of balance monthly(NOT pro-rated) up to max. 25%, more than 60d is lesser of $485 or 100% of tax.
;;Penalty for Failure to Pay: 0.5% of balance, up to 25%
;;IFF Fail to File & Pay: instead of a 5% failure to file penalty for the month, we apply a 4.5% failure to file penalty & a 0.5% failure to pay penalty.
;;Fail to pay Estimated tax: To avoid a penalty pay,
;;;you owe less than $1,000 or
;;;pay 90% of tax on current year or
;;;100% of prior year.
;;Fail to pay Interest: the federal short-term rate plus 3%. See Form 843, Claim for Refund & Request for Abatement
;;Form W4V for W/H of SS tax
;;SAFE HARBOR – $0 tax liability for prior year, taxpayer will not face an underpayment penalty if tax liability is under $1,000.
;;BACKUP W/H – used when name or SSN is wrong for US citizen of legal resident. This ensures Feds get 24% of any form of income, for example dividends, investment income, etc.

NOTE: IRS Form 8801, Use Form 8801 for: If you had an AMT, calculate the minimum tax credit, To calculate carry over to future years

9. Innocent or Injured Spouse provisions:
;;BOTH are difficult to win & take long time,
If one spouse does not want to pay for other FILE SEPARATELY, for example gambling addiction, student loans
;;Form 8857, Innocent Spouse relief, One party is innocent of a mistake made by the other.
;;Form 8379, Injured Spouse relief, One party is hurt/injured by the others past debts.

10. Special Filing Requirements:
;;Refunds & amendments generally go back 3 years.
;;An extension can extend liability window for refund or amendment
;;In some cases, late-filed returns will be honored, The IRS will consider reasons: Fire, casualty, FEMA natural disaster, Inability to obtain records, death, serious illness, incapacitation or unavoidable absence of the taxpayer or family member.
;;Certain situations allow taxpayers to request a refund past the usual deadline:
;;;bad debt from worthless securities (7 years),
;;;foreign tax payments (10 years), net operating loss or tax credit carrybacks, military personnel exceptions, federally declared disaster areas, & terrorism/military actions.
;;The IRS has 3 years to assess taxes from the filing date or the return's due date, whichever is later. If filed late or with an extension, the 3 years start from the actual filing date.
;;If no return is filed or it's fraudulent, there's no time limit for the IRS to assess taxes.
;;If income is under-reported by more than 25%, the IRS has 6 years to assess the tax.
;;The IRS has 10 years from the tax assessment date to collect unpaid taxes. This period starts when the tax is assessed, not when the return is filed. The Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED) marks the end of this period.
;;efile will not take filing > 3 years, filing > 3 years has to be paper filing with ink-signature, ALSO > 3 years will not receive refunds!!!
;;ALWAYS file returns, this can prevent id theft, or past filings on years you thought you had not tax liability & the statute of time limits starting running.


11. Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency
;;Five filing statuses – usually taxpayers may choose the filing status that will result in the lowest overall tax.
;;In general, a taxpayer’s marital status on December 31 determines their marital status for entire year.
;;ALTHOUGH, special rules apply to annulled marriages, widowed taxpayers, and surviving spouses who have dependent children
Filing Statuses – 5 Types
;;;Single
;;;Married Filing Jointly(MFJ)
;;;Married Filing Separately(MFS) “Default”
;;;Head of Household(HOH)
;;;Qualifying Surviving Spouse(QSS) – ex. widower with child dependent
;;Taxpayer can choose the status that nets the best result, lowest overall tax.
;;Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax
;;Publication 54, Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad
;;Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens
;;In general, a taxpayer’s marital status on December 31 determines their marital status for entire year.
;;ALTHOUGH, special rules apply to annulled marriages, widowed taxpayers, and surviving spouses who have dependent children
;;Note: Federal law does not allow Registered Domestic Partners (RDPs) to file a joint.
;;IRS does recognize common-law marriages. Currently, only states with common-law marriage are: the District of Columbia, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Texas.
;;The EA exam will not test on the matrimonial laws of any particular state, but you must know that only a legal marriage is recognized for IRS purposes, and not any other type of civil union nor registered domestic partnership.
;;Marriage licenses (IRM 25-018-001)

12. Single Status
;;Taxpayer is considered single for the entire tax year if, on 12/31, he or she was: Unmarried, Legally separated, Legally divorced by 12/31.

12. Married Filing Jointly (MFJ)
;;Filing status is an election, not the default. MFS IS default!
;;MFJ Req. BOTH signatures!  both spouses must agree to sign a MFJ, both are responsible for any tax, even if the income was earned by only one spouse. If one spouse does not wish to MFJ, then both spouses must default to MFS.
;;End of the year rule: If the they are married by 12/31 then they may file MFJ.
;;Can file jointly if they live apart but are not legally separated or divorced,
;;A widowed taxpayer may use MFJ, if the taxpayer’s spouse died during the year and the taxpayer has not remarried as of 12/31.
;;Nonresident Alien Spouses: Special rules apply to NRA spouses. A US citizen who is married to a NRA can elect MFL as long as both spouses agree to be taxed on their worldwide income. An election statement must be attached to the joint return.
;;Amending MFJ or MFS: “you can make up but you can’t break up.” In other words, you can easily go from MFS to file Jointly but it is harder to go from MFJ to MFS.
;;Moving from MFJ to MFS can be done when a death occurs.


13. Married Filing Separately (MFS)
;;If one spouse chooses MFS return, the other is forced to.
;;Specific features of the MFS (Rules)
;;;The tax rates are higher at the same levels of taxable income than MFJ
;;;The AMT exemption is half of a joint return.
;;;Various credits are either not allowed or more limited
;;;Capital loss deduction is $1,500, half of a joint return.
;;;Standard deduction is half of a joint return and cannot be claimed if the taxpayer’s itemizes deductions.
;;;6. Neither spouse can deduct student loan interest on an MFS return.

Example 1: Harrison and Regina are married and live together. They kept their assets and finances separate. Harrison plans to itemize his deductions this year, so Regina must either itemize her deductions or claim a standard zero deduction. The couple’s overall tax liability may be lower on a separate return when one spouse has significant medical expenses or large miscellaneous itemized deductions (such as a casualty loss).
---
Example 2: Daniel and Inara are married and live together. Daniel earns $120,000, while Inara earns $40,000. This year, Inara had high medical expenses due to a hip replacement. If they file jointly, the medical costs cannot be deducted because expenses do not exceed 7.5% of their joint AGI; however, if Daniel and Inara file separate returns, Inara’s medical expenses are deductible on her separate tax return, eliminating her tax liability entirely and resulting in a large tax refund. They calculate their taxes both ways and find their tax liability will be less by filing separately.
---
Example 3: Phillip and Dinah were married Dinah owes $80,000 in student loans. Phillip chooses to file separately, so her overdue tax debts will not offset his refund. He retains his entire refund.
---
Example 4: Hillard and Ingrid were married. Ingrid owes $15,000 in child support. Georgia does not have a provision for relief for injured spouses. Hillard decides to file a separate return to retain his federal and state tax refunds.

14. Amending Filing Status
;;There are strict  rules when married taxpayers change their filing status:
;;Taxpayers generally cannot change from MFJ to MFS after the due date of the return.
;;For example, if a married couple files a joint (2023) return on February 1, 2024, then decide they to change to MFS, they would have only until April 15, 2024 (their original return due date) to file amended returns to MFS filing status to amend file Form 1040-X.

;;A notable exception to this strict deadline allows a representative of a deceased taxpayer to change from a joint return, to the surviving spouse, to a separate return for the decedent for up to a year after the filing deadline.

Example: Landon and Bianca filed jointly. Bianca dies on November 16, 2023, and her will names Laura (her daughter from a previous marriage) as executor. Landon originally files a joint return with Bianca for 2023. Laura, as the executor, decides it would be better for the mother’s estate if Bianca's  files as MFS. Laura files an amended return claiming MFS status for Bianca and signs the return as the executor. Laura has a full year after the filing deadline to submit the amended return.

;;To change from separate returns to a joint return (MFS to MFJ]), taxpayers must file a return using Form 1040-X. They may do so any time within three years from the due date of the
;;original return (not including extensions).
;;Example: Jackie and Kaleb file separately for 2023. They choose to amend their prior-year separate tax returns to “married filing joint” by filing a Form 1040-X. They have up to three years to amend their returns.

Head of household will usually have a lower tax rate than (single or MFS) taxpayer and  receive a higher standard deduction.

The head of household status is available to taxpayers who meet all of the following requirements:

;;The taxpayer must be single, divorced, legally separated, or “considered unmarried” on the last
day of the year.
;;The taxpayer must have paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.
;;The taxpayer must have had a qualifying person living in his home for more than half the year. There are exceptions for temporary absences, as well as for a qualifying parent, who does not have to live with the taxpayer. This would include hospitalization and stays in a nursing home. For IRS purposes, “temporary absences” include time away from home going to college, vacation, business, medical care, hospitalization, military service, summer camp, and detention in a juvenile facility. It must be reasonable to assume that the absent person will return to the home after the temporary absence.

Example: Rhonda is unmarried. Her son, Nathaniel, was eighteen years old at the end of the year. Nathaniel lived away from his mother all year because he was going to college. He lived on campus, in the dorms, returning home only on holidays. Nathaniel does not work and does not provide any of his own support. Since his time away from home to attend school is considered a “temporary absence,” Rhonda may claim head of household filing status, and claim Nathaniel as her dependent.

When determining head of household filing status, valid household expenses used to calculate whether a taxpayer is paying more than half the cost of maintaining a home include:

1. Rent, mortgage interest, property taxes
2. Home insurance, repairs, and utilities
3. Food eaten in the home
4. Valid expenses do not include clothing, education, medical treatment, vacations, life insurance, or
transportation. Welfare payments are not considered amounts that the taxpayer provides to maintain
a home.

The “qualifying person” for the HOH filing status must generally be related to the taxpayer either
by blood, adoption, or marriage. However, a foster child also qualifies if the child was legally placed in
the home by a government agency. For purposes of the head of household filing status, a “qualifying
person” is defined as:

1. A qualifying child,
2. A married child who can be claimed as a dependent, or A dependent parent,
3. A qualifying relative that meets certain relationship tests
4. A taxpayer’s qualifying person may include: a child or stepchild, sibling or step-sibling, or a
descendant of any of these. For example, a niece or nephew, stepbrother or stepsister, or grandchild
may all be eligible as qualifying persons for the HOH filing status.3°

Example: Kevin is unmarried and age 64. He earns $49,000 in wages during the year. His disabled
sister, Francesca, has lived with him since their parents passed away six years ago. Francesca is 42 and
has severe autism. She cannot engage in any substantial gainful activity, but she does receive a small
amount of State Disability Assistance every month. These amounts are not taxable and Francesca does
not have a filing requirement. Kevin can file as head of household and claim Francesca as his qualifying child, because she meets the relationship test (she is his sibling), and she meets the age test for a qualifying child, because she is permanently disabled.

Example: Lamonte is 71 years old and unmarried. His daughter, Brooke, lived with him the entire year.
Brooke turned 29 at the end of the year. She does not have a job, did not provide any of her own
support, and cannot be claimed as a dependent by anyone else. She is not disabled. Although she cannot be Lamonte’s qualifying child, because of her age, she is a qualifying relative. As a result, Lamonte may use the HOH filing status.

Divorced and Noncustodial Parents: A taxpayer can qualify as HOH, even though they may not
claim a qualifying child as their dependent. This happens most often with divorced parents. This is
because the head of household filing status applies to the taxpayer who maintains the main home of a
qualifying child.

However, a custodial parent may choose to release the dependency exemption to a noncustodial
parent. In this scenario, the custodial parent would claim head of household filing status, while the
noncustodial parent would claim the dependency exemption.

Example: Nicolas and Vivian have been divorced for two years and they live apart. They have a twelve-year-old daughter named Cristina, who lives with her mother during the week and only sees her father on weekends. Therefore, Vivian is considered Cristina’s custodial parent. The parents agree, however, to allow Nicolas to claim the dependency exemption for Cristina on his tax return. Nicolas correctly files as “Single” and claims Cristina as his dependent. This entitles him to the Child Tax Credit. Vivian may still file as HOH if she otherwise qualifies, but she will not claim the dependency exemption for Cristina.

;;2. unearned income = first $1,250, next $1,250 is taxed at the child’s rate.
;;3. Anything above $2,500 is taxed at the parents’ rate

;;   for information returns (notably, Form 1099-NEC and 1099-MISC).
