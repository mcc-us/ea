The first time Anika came to the U.S. was in 2016,
when she arrived as a foreign student on an F-1 student visa
from her home country of India. She studied at Purdue
University in the U.S. until! the end of 2018 and then returned
home on December 31, 2018. She re-entered the U.S. on a J-1
student visa on January 5, 2023 to attend graduate school.
She is allowed to legally work for the university as a graduate
teaching assistant on a J-1 student visa. For federal income
tax purposes, Anika is still taxed as a nonresident alien in
2023, because she has been present in the U.S. for less than
five years as a student. She will report her earnings from her
on-campus job by filing Form 1040NR. This is frue even if she
remains in the U.S. the entire year.
