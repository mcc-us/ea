4. Question ID: 94849579 (Topic: Like-Kind Exchange)

Franklin owns a strip mall that he rents out to business tenants. His sister, Maribel, owns a residential rental property. Franklin exchanged his strip mall, plus $15,000, for his sister's property. At that time, the fair market value of his strip mall was $200,000 and its adjusted basis was $65,000. The fair market value of his sister's rental property was $215,000 and its adjusted basis was $70,000. What is Franklin's basis in the real property he received in this Section 1031 exchange?

    A. $70,000
    B. $80,000correct
    C. $185,000
    D. $65,000wrong

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 65% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Because this is a like-kind exchange and Franklin received no cash or non-like-kind property in the exchange, he will recognize no gain on the exchange. Franklin's basis in the real property he received is $80,000 (the $65,000 adjusted basis of the real property given up (the strip mall) plus the $15,000 cash he paid). His sister recognizes gain only to the extent of the money she received, $15,000. Her basis in the real property she received was $70,000 (the $70,000 adjusted basis of the real property she exchanged minus the $15,000 received, plus the $15,000 gain she recognized).

This MCQ is based directly on an example in IRS Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets.

1. Question ID: 94849539 (Topic: Like-Kind Exchange)

    A. Farmland
    B. Commercial office building
    C. Undeveloped land 
    D. A piece of factory equipmentcorrect

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 78% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

A piece of factory equipment would not be qualifying property for a Section 1031 exchange (a like-kind exchange). All types of real properties (real estate) generally qualify, regardless of whether they’re improved or unimproved. Due to changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, exchanges of machinery, equipment, vehicles, artwork, collectibles, patents and other intellectual property and intangible business assets generally do not qualify as like-kind exchanges. 

2. Question ID: 94849636 (Topic: Like-Kind Exchange)

Nhan exchanged a rental duplex in Boise, Idaho for an apartment four-plex in Houston, Texas; both are investment properties. The exchange is a qualified Section 1031 exchange. Nhan’s original purchase cost for the duplex was $65,000, and he had made $20,000 of capital improvements prior to the exchange. The apartment four-plex’s fair market value at the time of the exchange was $110,000. After the exchange is completed, what is Nhan's basis in the new Houston four-plex?

    A. $65,000
    B. $20,000
    C. $110,000
    D. $85,000correct

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 80% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

This is a Section 1031 exchange. Nhan does not recognize any gain from the like-kind exchange on his individual tax return. Nhan’s adjusted basis in the Boise duplex was $85,000 ($65,000 purchase cost + $20,000 capital improvements), so this is also the basis of the apartment four-plex he received in the exchange.

Note: A section 1031 like-kind exchange occurs when a taxpayer exchanges business or investment property for similar property. If the exchange qualifies under section 1031, he does not pay tax on a resulting gain and cannot deduct a loss until he disposes of the property. The basis of the property received is generally the adjusted basis of the property transferred. (Note: Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, now only exchanges of real property (i.e., real estate) qualifies for like-kind exchange treatment).

Study Unit 8: Nonrecognition Property Transactions covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 53% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

This is not a like-kind exchange, because inventory can never be exchanged under the rules for Section 1031 exchanges. This is a taxable event, and would likely be treated as a barter transaction. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Section 1031 now applies only to exchanges of real property and not to exchanges of personal property or intangible property. (This question is based on a prior-year EA exam question).
