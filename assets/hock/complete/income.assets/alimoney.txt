3. Question ID: 94815858 (Topic: Taxable Alimony)

Belinda is married to Jesse. They are both U.S. citizens and live in Montana, a non-community property state. They have no children. Because of financial problems caused by her first husband, Belinda refuses to file a joint return with anyone, including Jesse. Belinda files her own tax return separately. Belinda receives her W-2 from her employer. She earned $83,000 from her job. She also receives Form 1099-INT from her credit union, reporting $357 in interest earned on her savings account. She also paid $5,000 in alimony to her ex-husband, who she divorced in 2015. She has no other income or adjustments. Based on this information, what is her AGI?

    A. $78,000
    B. $83,000
    C. $83,357
    D. $78,357correct

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 82% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Her AGI (adjusted gross income) is $78,357, figured as follows:
$83,000 Wages +
$357 Interest income
$83,357 (this is Belinda's "gross income")
-$5,000 Alimony paid (this is an adjustment to income)
=$78,357 AGI

Note: Belinda's gross income includes her wages, interest, capital gains, income from retirement accounts. This total is then adjusted downward by specific deductions (including alimony paid) to arrive at AGI, or "adjusted gross income." Under the TCJA, an individual whose divorce was finalized in 2019 and pays alimony to an ex-spouse will no longer be able to deduct those payments. However, any divorce decree that was finalized before 2019 is considered “grandfathered” which means that those alimony payments remain deductible to the payor. Since Belinda's divorce was finalized in 2015, her decree is considered "grandfathered" and her alimony payments are still deductible.
