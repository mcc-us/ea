Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Boldo must report his prior year state tax refund as income on his federal tax return in the current year. A state refund is included in federal gross income in the year it is received, but only if the taxpayer itemized deductions in the year to which the refund relates. If the taxpayer had claimed the standard deduction in the prior year, and thus received no benefit from the state income taxes paid, the related refund would not be taxable.
