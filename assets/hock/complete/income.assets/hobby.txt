3. Question ID: 94849577 (Topic: Hobby Income)

Morty works full-time as a lifeguard. He is also a competitive surfer and has regularly participated in surfing competitions for the past six years with the intent to earn prize winnings. He has devoted significant time and effort to developing expertise in surfing, and he keeps good records that track his income and expenses associated with the surfing competitions. Morty has not yet earned a profit through the surfing competitions. As his tax preparer, what would you advise Morty?

    A. The surfing competitions constitute a business activity, so he can report his income and deduct his expenses on Schedule C.
    B. Morty does not have to claim any of the surfing competition income, but he is allowed to capitalize the expenses to a future year, for when he starts to make a profit. 
    C. Morty can choose to forego claiming the income and the expenses, since the activity is just a hobby.
    D. Morty is likely engaging in a hobby. His hobby-related expenses are not deductible, but his hobby income is taxable. correct

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 59% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

The IRS is likely to determine that Morty is engaging in a hobby and the surfing competitions are not a true business activity engaged in for profit. Although he maintains adequate records and enters surf competitions with the intent to earn money, he continues to enter competitions despite sustaining losses over several years, suggesting the lack of a true profit motive. A hobby is an activity typically undertaken primarily for pleasure. The IRS presumes that an activity is “carried on for a profit” if it makes a profit during at least three of the last five tax years, including the current year. Income from a hobby is taxable and reported on Form 1040 as “other income”. Expenses related to a hobby activity are no longer deductible due to changes implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
