Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 68% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Only the punitive damages are taxable. Settlements for personal physical injuries or physical illness are not taxable. Damages received for emotional distress due to physical injury or sickness are treated the same way as damages for physical injury or sickness, so they are not included in income. If emotional distress is not due to a physical injury (for example, an employment lawsuit in which a taxpayer suffers emotional distress for injury to reputation), the proceeds are taxable, except for any damages received for medical care due to that emotional distress. Emotional distress includes physical symptoms such as headaches, insomnia, and stomach disorders.
