Kendra bought a new car for $30,000. She made a $5,000 down payment and borrowed the remaining $25,000 from her bank via a recourse loan. After she stopped making payments, the bank repossessed the car. The balance due on the loan at the time of the repossession was $15,000. The FMV of the car when repossessed was $12,000. She later receives a 1099-C for the canceled debt. She was not insolvent when the debt was canceled, because she has $40,000 in a traditional IRA account. What amount is Kendra’s loss and what amount must she report as cancellation of debt income?

    A. $15,000 nondeductible loss; $12,000 COD.
    B. $13,000 deductible loss; $0 COD.
    C. $18,000 nondeductible loss; $3,000 COD.correct
    D. $13,000 nondeductible loss; $3,000 COD.wrong

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 38% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

A taxpayer is personally liable for a recourse loan. Since a repossession is treated as a sale, the gain or loss must be computed. Kendra compares the amount realized ($12,000) with her adjusted basis ($30,000) in the vehicle to determine that she has an $18,000 nondeductible loss. She also has ordinary income from cancellation of debt. That income is $3,000 ($15,000 canceled debt − $12,000 FMV). Kendra must report the canceled debt as income on her Form 1040.

    A. Nonrecourse loanscorrect
    B. Mortgage loans
    C. Recourse loans
    D. Credit card debt wrong

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 32% of students.

5. Question ID: 94850120 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)

Isaac has canceled debt from a foreclosure on his vacation home. The mortgage on the property was a recourse debt. What does this mean?

    A. A recourse debt means that the debt is unsecured.
    B. It means that the lender cannot pursue anything other than the collateral.
    C. A recourse debt means that Isaac is personally liable for the loan.correct
    D. A recourse debt means that Issac must file a civil action.wrong

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 80% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

A recourse debt holds the borrower personally liable. This means that Isaac is personally liable for the mortgage. All other debt is considered nonrecourse. A nonrecourse debt (loan) does not allow the lender to pursue anything other than the collateral. For example, if a borrower defaults on a nonrecourse home loan, the bank can only foreclose on the home. The bank generally cannot take further legal action to collect the money owed on the debt. Whether a debt is recourse or nonrecourse may depend on state law.

6. Question ID: 94849728 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)

Joel’s primary residence is subject to a $320,000 mortgage debt. His basis in the home is $340,000. Joel loses his job and is unable to make his mortgage payments, so his bank forecloses on the home on January 10, 2023. Due to declining real estate values in his city, Joel's former residence is sold for $280,000 on December 15, 2023, as a short-sale. The debt was canceled by the mortgage lender and Joel receives a Form 1099-C reporting the cancellation. Joel was not insolvent at the time. What amount of taxable income from cancellation of debt must Joel report on his tax return?

    A. $0correct
    B. $60,000
    C. $40,000
    D. $30,000wrong

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 46% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Joel has $40,000 of cancelled debt from the discharge of indebtedness. However, none of the canceled debt is taxable to Joel because it is excluded from income because it is primary residence indebtedness. Qualified principal residence indebtedness can be excluded from income. Generally, if a taxpayer excludes canceled debt from income, the taxpayer must attach Form 982, Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness, to report the amount of debt qualifying for exclusion. To learn more about cancellation of debt, see IRS Topic No. 431, Canceled Debt.

10. Question ID: 94849617 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)

When Danny and June married five years ago, June's parents loaned them $30,000 for a down payment on their first house. Danny and June made regular payments on the loan until June's parents were killed in an accident in 2023. When they died, Danny and June still owed $17,500 on the balance of the loan. One of the terms of June's parents’ will was that any balance remaining on the loan would be forgiven at their death and would be considered a gift. How should this be reported on Danny and June's joint tax return?

    A. Danny and June do not have to recognize income due to the forgiveness of the debt. No reporting is required.correct
    B. Danny and June do not have to recognize income due to the forgiveness of the debt, but they are required to file a gift tax return.
    C. Danny and June have to recognize income due to the forgiveness of the debt, but only the amount above the gift limit.
    D. Danny and June have to recognize $17,500 in income due to the forgiveness of the debt.wrong

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 34% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Danny and June do not have to recognize income due to the forgiveness of the debt. No reporting is required. Loans forgiven as gifts are not taxed. If a debt is canceled by a private lender, such as a relative or friend, and the cancellation is intended as a gift, there is no income that has to be reported. Danny and June are not required to file gift tax returns, because any gift tax reporting is always done by the donor (not the donee, or the recipient of the gift).

13. Question ID: 94815960 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 79% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

The recourse debt on a vehicle would likely be taxable canceled debt. If a lender forecloses on property subject to a recourse debt and cancels the portion of the debt in excess of the fair market value (FMV) of the property, the canceled portion of the debt is treated as ordinary income from cancellation of indebtedness. This amount must be included in gross income unless it qualifies for an exception or exclusion. The exclusions are:

    Discharge of debt through bankruptcy.
    Discharge of debt of insolvent taxpayer.
    Discharge of qualified farm indebtedness.
    Discharge of qualified real property business indebtedness.
    Discharge of qualified principal residence indebtedness.

    A. The collateral on the loan.correct
    B. Personal and business assets.
    C. Wages or bank accounts.
    D. Personal assets only.wrong

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 85% of students.

A nonrecourse debt (loan) does not allow the lender to pursue anything other than the collateral. For example, if a borrower defaults on a nonrecourse home loan, the bank can only foreclose on the home. The bank generally cannot take further legal action to collect the money owed on the debt. If a lender cancels a debt and issues Form 1099-C to the taxpayer, the lender will indicate on the form if the borrower was personally liable (recourse) for repayment of the debt. The tax impact depends on the type of debt - recourse or nonrecourse. See IRS Tax Topic No. 431, Canceled Debt.

15. Question ID: 95003697 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)

Shane fell on hard times and stopped paying his mortgage in the prior year. His home was later foreclosed. At the time of foreclosure, he owed a balance of $190,000 to the lender and the FMV of the property was $150,000 at the time of the foreclosure. For tax purposes, the foreclosure is treated as a sale. Shane's mortgage loan was nonrecourse. Based on this information, what would the "sale price" be for reporting this transaction?

    A. The sale price would be $0.
    B. The sale price would be $150,000.
    C. The sale price would be $40,000.
    D. The sale price would be $190,000.correct

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 29% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Since Shane is not personally liable for the debt (a nonrecourse loan), the "selling price" would be $190,000. Nonrecourse debt is satisfied by the surrender of the secured property regardless of the FMV at the time of surrender, and the borrower is not personally liable for the debt. If property that is subject to nonrecourse debt is abandoned, foreclosed upon, subject of a short sale, or repossessed by the lender, the circumstances are treated as a sale of the property by the taxpayer. In determining the gain or loss on the disposition of the property, the balance of the non-recourse debt at the time of the disposition of the property is included in the amount realized (generally the selling price). Since Shane is not personally liable for the debt, the difference between the FMV of the property and the balance of the loan is not included in his gross income (see detailed example in Publication 4491).
