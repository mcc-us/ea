This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 62% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Usman must report all his gambling winnings on his federal income tax return, even for the amounts for which he did not receive Forms W-2G. He can deduct his gambling losses on Schedule A, but the deduction is limited to the amount of his winnings. In other words, the MOST that he would be able to deduct in losses is the amount of his winnings (you can't deduct more gambling losses than you win in a single year). He must report his winnings as income and claim his allowable losses separately; he cannot reduce his winnings by his losses and report the difference.

    D. $21,425wrong

Study Unit 10: Other Taxable Income covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 59% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Lisa must report her wages, interest income, gambling income, and settlement from a discrimination lawsuit in her gross income ($14,000 + $425 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $25,425). The child support payments and the food stamp benefits are not taxable. The legal fees would be deductible as an adjustment to income, but she still must report the entire gross amount of the settlement. The gambling losses do not affect the inclusion of the gambling income within gross income. However, if Lisa chooses to itemize deductions, her gambling losses may be deducted on Schedule A to the extent of her gambling income. If Ginny does not itemize, the gambling losses are not deductible.
