"On January 30, Tracy received two acres of land as a gift from her brother, Matthew. At the time of the gift, the land had an FMV of $77,000. Matthew’s adjusted basis in the land was $74,000. Tracy then spent $2,000 of her own funds to clear tree stumps from the land. On December 31, Tracy sold the property for $76,500. How should she report this transaction on her tax return?A. $500 loss.B. $2,500 loss.C. $500 gain.D. $2,500 gain.","C:Tracy has to recognize a $500 gain on the sale of the land. The basis of property received as a gift is figured differently than property that is purchased. Generally, the basis of gifted property is the same in the hands of the donee as it was in the hands of the donor, but may also include the amount of gift tax paid by a donor, if any. If the fair market value of the property on the date of the gift is less than the transferred basis, the donee’s basis for gain is the transferred basis. However, if the donee reports a loss on the sale of gifted property, her basis is the lower of the transferred basis or the FMV of gifted property. The sale of gifted property can also result in no gain or loss. This happens when the sale proceeds are greater than the gift’s FMV, but less than the transferred basis. Tracy has a $500 gain because she uses the donor's adjusted basis at the time of the gift ($74,000) plus the amount that she spent to clear the property ($2,000) as the basis to figure gain. Therefore, since she sold the property for $76,500 she has a $500 capital gain, calculated as follows:($74,000 + $2,000) = $76,000 basis($76,500 - $76,000) = $500 capital gain on sale"

Nicole's basis in the watch is adjusted to the fair market value.","Incorrect Answer Explanation for D:There are no tax implications, and Nicole's basis in the watch remains the same as Kareem's basis. Generally, the basis of gifted property for the donee is equal to the donor's adjusted basis. This is called a 'transferred basis.'

"Hester acquired an acre of farmland as a gift from her aunt. At the time of the gift, the acre had a fair market value (FMV) of $19,000. Her aunt's adjusted basis in the land was $14,000. No gift tax was paid on the gift. No events occurred to increase or decrease her basis in the property. Hester later sold the acre of land at a bargain price of $10,000, because she wanted the cash from a quick sale. What is Hester's gain (or loss) on the sale?A. $0 (no gain or loss)B. $9,000 lossC. $10,000 lossD. $4,000 loss","D:Hester's loss is $4,000 ($14,000 - $10,000 sale price). Since she sold the property at a loss, her basis in the land for calculating the loss is $14,000, because it is the lower of her aunt's adjusted basis and the fair market value on the date of the gift. See IRS Publication 551, Basis of Assets, for more information on how to calculate the basis of gifted property."
"Basis of Inherited Property Kendria inherited 100 shares of stock from her father, who died on May 3, 2023. Her father’s adjusted basis in the stock was $42,000 just before he passed away. On May 3 (the date of her father's death) the stock’s fair market value was $78,000. On November 3, 2023, (6 months after the date of her father’s death) the stock's value was $72,000. The 100 shares of stock was finally distributed to Kendria by the estate’s executor on December 7, 2023. On the date of distribution, the stock’s value was $71,000. The estate is worth over 19 million dollars and the estate's executor must file an estate tax return (Form 706). The executor selected the alternate valuation for the estate. What is Kendria’s basis in the inherited stock for determining gain or loss?A. $71,000B. $72,000C. $78,000D. $42,000","B:Kendria’s basis is $72,000, the fair market value on the alternate valuation date, which is six months after the date of the decedent’s death. The basis of property received from a decedent's estate is generally the fair market value of the property on the date of the decedent’s death. If the executor of the estate elects the alternate valuation date for the estate tax return, the basis of assets is their fair market value six months after the date of death."
"Jennifer inherited 1,000 shares of stock from her grandmother, who died on February 1, 2023. Her grandmother had originally paid $10 per share when she purchased the stock several years prior. The fair market value of that stock on February 1 was $13 per share. Nine months later, on November 1, Jennifer sold all the stock for $14 a share. No estate tax return was filed for her grandmother's estate. What is the amount and nature of Jennifer's gain?A. $1,000 in long-term capital gain.B. $1,000 in short-term capital gain.C. $4,000 in short-term capital gain.D. $4,000 in long-term capital gain.","A:She has $1,000 in long-term capital gain. Her cost basis of the stock is the fair market value of that stock as of the date of the decedent's death. Since the FMV of the stock was $13 on the date of her grandmother's death, then her basis would be $13,000 ($13 x 1,000 shares) Therefore, if Jennifer sells all the stock for $14 a share and on the date of death the value was $13 a share, then she would pay tax on $1 a share ($14,000 sales price - $13,000 stepped-up basis). Since the stock was inherited, it would automatically be treated as long term capital gains."
"Horatio's sister, Melinda, died during the year. Horatio inherited 300 shares of stock from Melinda. She had paid $4,000 for the shares over ten years ago. On the date of Melinda's death, the stock was valued at $14,500. On December 31, Horatio sold all the stock for $15,100. What is the amount and nature of his gain (or loss)?A. $600 long-term capital gain.B. $0 gain or loss.C. $11,100 long-term capital gain.D. $600 short-term capital gain.","A:Horatio’s gain is $600, and it is long-term. Since Horatio inherited the stock, he uses the stepped-up basis to calculate gain or loss on the stock, (the deceased person’s original basis is irrelevant). The basis of inherited property is generally the FMV of the property on the date of the decedent's death. Inherited property is always considered long-term, regardless of how long it was held by either the decedent or the beneficiary."
"Trenton wishes to sell a home that he inherited from his deceased mother in San Francisco. His mother paid $45,000 for the home over forty years ago.

Usually, heirs use a stepped-up basis for inherited property, regardless of what the deceased person actually paid for the asset, and regardless of any improvements that the decedent made to the home while they were still alive.Note: The basis of inherited property is generally the FMV of the property on the date of the decedent's death.

"Basis of Inherited Property,Cyrus died on March 19, 2023. Before his death, he was an active stamp collector, which he did as a hobby and shared with his granddaughter, Robin, who also became a serious hobbyist. At the time of Cyrus’ death, his collection had a fair market value of $20,000 and an adjusted basis of $4,000, while Robin’s smaller stamp collection had a fair market value of $8,000 and an adjusted basis of $2,000.

What is Robin’s taxable gain on the sale of the stamps?A. $34,000B. $26,000C. $10,000D. $18,000","D:The basis of inherited property is generally the FMV of the property on the date of the decedent's death. This means that if the property is sold by the beneficiary, gain will be calculated based on the change in value from the date of death. The answer is calculated as follows: $40,000 sales price minus $20,000 (stepped-up basis of Cyrus' stamp collection) and $2,000 (basis of Robin’s collection) = $18,000 taxable gain.Note: Stamps are considered a collectible and subject to a special capital gains tax rate. If a taxpayer has collectibles that are sold at a gain, the gains will be subject to a maximum long-term capital gains tax rate of up to 28%. Collectibles include works of art, rugs, gemstones, antiques, and precious metals, and collectible coins."
