To correctly calculate gains and losses, you must also understand the
concept of “basis.” The initial basis of an asset is usually its cost.
However, there are instances in which basis is determined based upon
the fair market value of the asset when acquired by the taxpayer, rather
than its cost, typically when property is acquired by inheritance and
sometimes by gift. The basis of an asset may include:

Sales taxes charged during the purchase

Freight-in charges and shipping fees

Installation costs and testing fees

Delinquent real estate taxes that are paid by the buyer of a property
The cost of any major improvements to the property

Legal and accounting fees for transferring an asset

Legal fees for obtaining title to a property

All of these costs will an asset's basis. The result of these
adjustments to the basis is the “adjusted” basis.
