"Elizabeth owns 450 shares of Hess Corporation stock. Her cost basis is $15 per share. At the end of the year, Hess Corporation issues a 2-for-1 stock split. What is Elizabeth’s new basis per share after the stock split?A. $15B. $8C. $30D. $7.50","D:Elizabeth's new basis per share is $7.50. She has 900 shares after the stock split. 450 original shares x 2 = 900 shares.Her basis per share is figured as follows:450 original number of shares x $15 = $6,750 cost basis,$6,750 ÷ 900 shares after the split = $7.50 new basis per share.A stock split is an increase in the number of shares outstanding. When an investor is granted stock in a 2 for 1 stock split, the cost basis stays the same, but it is 'spread over' double the number of shares. In other words, the basis of the overall stock remains the same; it is only the per-share basis that is reduced."

"Daniel buys shares of ABC stock. On January 1, 2023, he bought 100 shares at $10 per share. On April 1, he bought another 100 shares at $12 per share.

The new per share basis is $6 ($1,200/200 = $6).A stock split occurs when a company creates additional shares, thus reducing the price per share. If you own stock that has split and now own additional shares, you must adjust your basis per share or per the lots of the stock you own. If the old shares of stock and the new shares are uniform and identical: Allocate the basis of the old shares to the old and new shares. You must determine the per-share basis by dividing the adjusted basis of the old stock by the number of shares of old and new stock. See: Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses."

"During the current year, Ishmael purchased a new utility van for his package delivery business. The van is used 100% for business. He reports his income and loss on Schedule C. His costs were as follows:Cost of the van: $64,000.Sales tax on the van: $3,850.Title transfer charges: $700.Installation of special equipment: $1,500.Personal property taxes on the van: $2,000 (DMV registration fees).Q. What is Ishmael’s depreciable basis in this utility van?A. $72,050B. $66,200C. $68,550D. $70,050","D:The answer is calculated as follows: $64,000 cost of van + $3,850 sales tax + $700 transfer charges + $1,500 installation charges = $70,050.The basis of property is generally its cost. Sales tax paid in acquisition of property is treated as a cost of the property. Delivery charges, installation, and testing also are included as part of the cost of property. Personal property taxes, however, are not treated as a cost of the property. The DMV fees would be deductible as a current business expense on Schedule C, and not included in the basis of the van.

"On May 11, 2023, the Barberry Corporation granted 800 incentive stock options to their top sales executive, Julie, with an option price of $15. On December 31, 2023, Julie exercised all of her stock options when the market price per share was $23. Once she exercised her options, she decided to hold onto the stock for investment purposes. What is the basis of her stock and how much should be included on Julie's Form W-2 as income for the year?

A. Basis $0; income $0.
B. Basis $12,000; income $6,400.
C. Basis $12,000; income $0.
D. Basis $12,000; income $12,000.



C:

For incentive stock options, (ISOs) the basis in the stock is the actual price per share paid upon exercise of the options. In this case, the executive’s basis is 800 × $15 = $12,000. The bargain element attributable to the difference between the exercise price and the value at the date of exercise ([$23 - $15] × 800 shares = $6,400) is not recognized until the stock is sold. However, the taxpayer may need to make an adjustment for alternative minimum tax (AMT) purposes for the bargain element. When the stock is later sold, she will recognize gain equal to the difference between her basis and the net proceeds of the sale.

"On March 3, Gary buys 100 shares of Grunge Inc. stock at $3 per share. On October 1, he bought 200 shares of Handy Caddy, Inc. at $18 per share. On December 31, the stock in both companies split 3 for 1. What are Gary's total shares and his basis per share in each company's stock after the 3-for-1 split?

A. Grunge Inc: 150 shares at $1.50 per share; Handy Caddy: 300 shares at $12 per share
B. Grunge Inc: 300 shares at $3 per share; Handy Caddy: 600 shares at $12 per share

D. Grunge Inc: 300 shares at $1 per share; Handy Caddy: 600 shares at $6 per share



D:

On March 3, Gary buys 100 shares of Grunge Inc. stock at $3 per share. On October 1, he bought 200 shares of Handy Caddy, Inc. at $18 per share. The resulting 3-for-1 stock split means that Gary owns the following shares at the end of the year:

Grunge Inc: 300 shares at $1 per share (the 3-for-1 split: 3 x 100 original shares = 300 shares, then divide the total basis (100 x $3 = $300 original basis) by 300, which equals $1 per share)
Handy Caddy: 600 shares at $6 per share (the 3-for-1 split: 3 x 200 original shares = 600 shares, then divide the total basis (200 x $18 = $3,600 original basis) by 600, which equals $6 per share)

"Hyun purchases an empty parking lot for $90,000 at a county property auction. He plans to use the property for investment purposes. He pays $20,000 in cash and finances the remaining $70,000 with a bank loan. The lot has a $12,000 lien against it for unpaid property taxes that were owed by the previous owner. Hyun agrees to pay the delinquent property taxes as a condition of the sale. Which of the following statements is correct?

A. His basis in the property is $90,000, and he can deduct the property taxes on his Schedule A as property taxes paid.
B. His basis in the property is $78,000.
C. His basis in the property is $32,000.
D. His basis in the property is $102,000.



D:

Hyun's basis in the property is determined as follows: ($90,000 + $12,000 = $102,000). Hyun cannot deduct the delinquent property taxes as a current expense, because the property taxes were not his liability (they were assessed on the previous owner and owed by the previous owner). Any obligations of the seller that are assumed by the buyer increase the basis of the asset, and are not currently deductible. Since Hyun did not own the property when the taxes accrued but agreed to pay them as a condition of the sale, he should add the property tax payment to his basis in the property.

"Maura was granted 50 nonqualified stock options by her employer, Yancey Corporation, on June 8, 2023, to purchase stock in the company. At the date of the grant, the company was privately-held and the FMV of the stock was not readily determinable. The option price was $10 a share. Yancey Corporation completed an initial public offering (IPO) on November 1, and Maura exercised her options on December 15, 2023. The stock’s FMV on the exercise date was $32 a share. Maura immediately sold the stock upon exercise and received gross proceeds of $1,600. How should Maura report this transaction on her tax return?

A. Ordinary income of $1,100
B. Dividend income of $1,600
C. Capital gain of $1,600
D. Capital gain of $1,100



A:

The difference between the option price ($10/share) and the FMV ($32/share) is included in Maura’s taxable compensation ($22 × 50 shares = $1,100) and thus is taxable as ordinary income. For more information and examples of stock options, see IRS Tax Topic 427, Stock Options.

"When calculating the basis of stock or other securities held for investment, which of the following costs would NOT be included in a stock's basis?A. Interest paid on a margin loan.B. Broker's commissions.C. Recording fees.D. Direct costs of purchase.","A:The basis of stocks or bonds is generally the purchase price plus the costs of purchase, such as broker's commissions and recording or transfer fees. In most cases, the cost basis of an investment is the original purchase price upon acquisition. However, interest incurred on a margin loan would not be included in the basis of securities. Instead, investment interest expense is a tax deduction.Note: Investment interest expense is the interest paid on money borrowed to purchase taxable investments. This includes interest incurred on margin loans for buying stock in a brokerage account. This deduction is limited to the amount of net investment income."

"During the year, Jennifer received a 2-for-1 stock split on her Apple stock. She held 100 shares of stock before the split. After the split, she had 200 shares.

"Jaxton bought 4 shares of common stock in Alter Corporation for $200. Later in the same year, the corporation distributed additional shares in a 2-for-1 stock split. At the date of the split, the common stock had a fair market value of $40 per share. What is Jaxton basis in each share after this stock dividend?A. $25B. $50C. $100D. $20","A:His basis in each share of stock after the stock dividend is $25 per share ($200 original basis ÷ 8 shares). His original cost basis was $50 per share ($200 ÷ 4 shares), which was spread out over 4 shares of common stock. Later, the corporation issued a 2-for-1 stock split, which doubled his shares. The fair market value of the stock at the time of the stock split is irrelevant in this scenario. To find the basis after a stock split, you take the original investment amount and divide it by the new number of shares to arrive at the new per-share cost basis."

What is Benny's basis per share AFTER the stock split?A. $5 per shareB. $10 per shareC. $1 per shareD. $20 per share","A:A 2-for-1 stock split doubles the amount of the taxpayer's shares. In other words, a 2-for-1 stock split means that for every one share held by an investor, there will now be two. After a stock split, the way to calculate the basis per share is to take the taxpayer's original investment amount ($10,000) and divide it by the new number of shares (2,000) to arrive at the new per-share cost basis ($10,000/2,000 = $5 per share)."

What is Vikki’s basis in the rental property?A. $208,000B. $65,000C. $200,000D. $215,000","A:The answer is calculated as follows: $200,000 sales price + $8,000 closing costs = $208,000 basis. The basis of real estate may include a number of costs in addition to the purchase price. If a taxpayer purchases real property, certain fees and other expenses are included in the cost basis. They may include real estate taxes the seller owed at the time of the purchase, if the real estate taxes were paid by the buyer.
