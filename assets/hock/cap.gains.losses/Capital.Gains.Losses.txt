Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 93% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

She must pay her net capital gain on the sale of the painting. The amount is calculated as follows: $6,000 income - $1,500 commission fees - $175 initial basis = $4,325 long-term capital gain. The gain is long-term, because she held the painting for more than one year. She will pay taxes on this amount. The painting is considered a collectible, which includes artwork, antiques, jewelry, etc. She will be subject to a long-term capital gains tax rate of up to 28%.

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 88% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Dolly has a current-year capital loss of $5,500 ($8,000 short-term loss - $2,500 long-term capital gain). Her capital losses are limited, and she can only use $3,000 in the current year to offset ordinary income. The remaining $2,500 in losses must be carried over to future tax years. The losses can be carried forward indefinitely, because a capital loss carryforward does not expire (except upon death). To learn more about capital gains and losses, see IRS Topic No. 409 Capital Gains and Losses.

4. Question ID: 94849568 (Topic: Capital Gains and Losses)

On January 1, Geneva paid $10,000 for 100 shares of stock in Agri-Barn, Inc. a start-up company. Six months after she bought it, she sold the stock to her brother, Henry, for $8,000, which was its current market value. Two months later, the stock suddenly shoots up in value, and on December 31, Henry sells all the stock to an unrelated party for $16,000. What gain or loss should Geneva and Henry recognize on their tax returns in the year of sale?

    A. Geneva recognizes $2,000 capital loss; Henry recognizes $7,000 capital gain.
    B. Geneva recognizes $0 capital loss; Henry recognizes $8,000 capital gain.
    C. Geneva recognizes $0 capital loss; Henry recognizes $6,000 capital gain.correct
    D. Geneva recognizes $2,000 capital loss; Henry recognizes $8,000 capital gain.wrong

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 47% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

This is a related party transaction, and special rules apply. Geneva recognizes $0 capital loss; Henry recognizes $6,000 capital gain. This is because Geneva cannot claim a loss on the sale of stock to her own brother. Losses from sale or exchange of property, directly or indirectly, are disallowed between related parties. When the property is later sold to an unrelated party, any previously disallowed loss may be used to offset gain on that transaction. However, since Henry sold the stock at a profit, he would be able to use the basis of the original seller (his sister's basis was $10,000, this is called a "transferred basis") in order to calculate his own gain on the sale. 

6. Question ID: 94849852 (Topic: Capital Gains and Losses)

    A. $2,964
    B. $5,964correct
    C. $0
    D. $6,912wrong

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 93% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Alice can carry over $5,964 ($8,964 - $3,000) to the following year. Alice would only be able to deduct $3,000 of her capital losses against her wage income. The remaining capital losses must be carried over (the capital loss limit is $1,500 for taxpayers that file MFS). To learn more about how taxpayers can deduct capital losses, see IRS Topic No. 409 Capital Gains and Losses.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 83% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

His net capital gain is $17,000. He realizes a $25,000 ($65,000 - $40,000) capital gain on the sale of the vase, which is offset by the capital loss of $8,000 ($20,000 - $12,000.) He may offset the gains with the losses from the sale of both collectibles. The gain is long-term, because he held the collectibles for more than one year. A "collectible" is defined by the IRS as:

    Artwork, rugs or antiques,
    Precious metals or gemstones,
    Stamps, comic books, collectible cards, like baseball cards
    Alcoholic beverages (like premium wines),

    D. $1,100 short-term capital loss.wrong

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 75% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

The price Alain paid per share was $15,000 divided by 1,000 shares, or $15. The basis for the shares he sold was $15 × 600 = $9,000. He held the shares for 13 months (over one year). Therefore, he has a long-term capital loss of $1,100 ($9,000 - $7,900).

12. Question ID: 94850124 (Topic: Capital Gains and Losses)

Morgan buys 100 shares of Fairview Property stock and then later sells them for a $500 loss. Almost immediately, though, she regrets the sale, so she decides to repurchase the same number of shares of Fairview Property. How long must Morgan wait after the sale of the stock in order to avoid the wash sale rules?

    A. 30 days.
    B. 31 days.correct
    C. 365 days.
    D. 366 days.wrong

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 50% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Under the wash sales rules, Morgan must wait 31 days after the sale of the initial stock before purchasing identical shares if she wants to be able to deduct her loss from the earlier sale. The wash sale rules disallow recognition of a loss from a sale if the taxpayer purchases identical securities within 30 days before or 30 days after the sale date.

15. Question ID: 94849604 (Topic: Capital Gains and Losses)

Larry bought 140 shares of stock from his sister, Ezra, for $7,600. Her original cost basis on the stock was $10,000. Larry sold all the shares two years later through a stockbroker for $11,500. What is his recognized gain on the sale?

    A. $3,900 gain.
    B. $1,500 gain.correct
    C. $6,100 gain.
    D. $2,400 gain.wrong

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 57% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

The sale between Larry and his sister is a related-party transaction, and is therefore subject to special rules. If, in a purchase or exchange, a taxpayer received property from a related person who had a loss that was not allowable and the taxpayer later sells the property at a gain, the taxpayer will recognize the gain only to the extent it is more than the loss previously disallowed to the related person. Although Ezra lost $2,400 in the original sale to her brother, the loss was not deductible. When Larry later sold the same stock to an unrelated party for $11,500, he realized a gain of $3,900. However, the recognized gain is only $1,500 (the portion of the gain that is more than the $2,400 loss not allowed to his sister).

16. Question ID: 94849652 (Topic: Capital Gains and Losses)

Malila purchased 300 shares of Berger Electronics Inc. stock ten years ago. Her basis per share is $4. On January 5, 2023, Berger Electronics issues a 2-for-1 stock dividend, increasing her total shares to 600. On November 26, 2023, Malila sells all 600 shares for $9 per share. What is the amount and nature of her gain?

    A. $4,200 long-term capital gain.correct
    B. $4,200 short-term capital gain.
    C. $2,100 long-term capital gain and $2,100 short-term capital gain.
    D. $5,400 long-term capital gain.wrong

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 79% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

A stock dividend does not increase basis. Instead, the original basis of the stock is spread over the additional shares. Stock acquired in a stock dividend or stock split has the same holding period as the original stock owned. Since Malila's original stock has a long-term holding period, the stock she received in a stock dividend also has a long-term holding period and all of her gain is long-term. The answer is calculated as follows:

300 shares × $4 per share = $1,200 (taxpayer’s basis before stock dividend)
600 shares × $2 per share = $1,200 (taxpayer’s basis after stock dividend)
600 shares × $9 per share = $5,400 (gross sale price)
$5,400 - $1,200 = $4,200 long-term capital gain

17. Question ID: 94849642 (Topic: Capital Gains and Losses)

    A. She should report the $80 as a long-term capital gain on Schedule D.correct
    B. She should report the $80 as a short-term capital gain on Schedule D.
    C. She should not report it, instead she needs to reduce the basis of her stock by $80.
    D. She should report the $80 on Schedule B as an ordinary dividend.wrong

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 30% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

She should report the $80 on Schedule D as a long-term capital gain. Under IRS regulations, capital gain distributions from a mutual fund are always taxed as long-term capital gains, no matter how long the taxpayer has owned the stock.

18. Question ID: 94850076 (Topic: Capital Gains and Losses)

Jenny owns stock that became worthless last year, because the corporation filed for bankruptcy. Her basis in the stock is $5,500, which is how much she originally paid. She did not sell the stock. The only other income she has for the year is $52,000 in wages. Is her loss deductible, and if so, how should she report the loss?

    A. She cannot take a capital loss until she sells the stock to an unrelated buyer.
    B. This loss should be reported as a bad debt deduction on Schedule A.
    C. This loss should be reported as a capital loss, which would be limited to $3,000 in the current year. Any unused losses would be carried forward. correct
    D. This loss should be reported as a casualty loss. She can take the entire $5,500 loss in the current year. wrong

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 71% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Jenny should report the loss as a capital loss; the loss would be limited to $3,000 in the current year, and she can carryover the unused loss indefinitely. If a taxpayer owns stock that becomes totally worthless, this would be reported as a capital loss on Schedule D. The stock does not have to be sold if the stock is truly worthless, because worthless securities have no market value. See more about the rules for worthless securities.

    D. Cedric may deduct $8,500 of short-term capital losses against his wages.wrong

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 92% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Cedric has a current-year capital loss of $4,500 ($9,000 short-term loss - $4,500 long-term capital gain). Adding the $4,000 capital loss carried over from the prior tax year, he has a net capital loss of $8,500 for the year. However, his capital losses are limited. He can only use $3,000 in the current year to offset his ordinary income. The remaining $5,500 in losses must be carried over to future tax years.

    A. Long-term capital gain of $530.correct
    B. Long-term capital gain of $500, Short-term capital gain of $30.
    C. Long-term capital gain of $2,030.
    D. Short-term capital gain of $530.wrong

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 83% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Although the taxpayer owned the 10 shares he received as a nontaxable stock dividend for only a few days, all the stock has a long-term holding period. Stock acquired as a stock dividend has the same holding period as the original stock owned. Because he bought the stock for $1,500 and then sold it for $2,030 more than a year later, he has a long-term capital gain of $530 on the sale of the 610 shares.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

The answer is calculated as follows: The Ellison Corporation stock loss of $9,000 ($14,000 minus $5,000) is netted against the Martinez Company stock gain of $4,500 ($7,500 minus $3,000), for a net long-term capital loss of $4,500. A taxpayer can deduct up to $3,000 ($1,500 for MFS) of net capital losses against ordinary income in a tax year. (Taxpayers filing jointly are also limited to a $3,000 deduction.) They can carry forward the remaining $1,500 loss ($4,500 loss minus $3,000). Any excess capital loss can be carried over for an unlimited time until it is used up. A capital loss carried over to a later tax year retains its long-term or short-term character. A short-term capital loss carryover first offsets short-term gain in the carryover year. If a net short-term capital loss results, this loss offsets long-term capital gain. Any remaining net loss can then be used to offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income.

Kandy received a 1099-DIV showing a $180 capital gain distribution from her mutual fund investment. However, she never sold any of her mutual fund shares during the year. What is the most likely scenario for this event?

    A. This is a nontaxable event. The amount lowers her basis in her shares. 
    B. This is obvious securities fraud and she should file a police report.
    C. The 1099-DIV is likely incorrect, and the income is not taxable.
    D. This is a taxable capital gain and generally must be reported on Schedule D.correct

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 65% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

This is a taxable capital gain and generally must be reported on Schedule D. The taxpayer owns shares in the mutual fund, but the fund owns capital assets, such as shares of stock, corporate bonds, government obligations, etc. One of the ways the fund makes money is to sell these assets at a gain. A mutual fund is a regulated investment company that pools funds of investors allowing them to take advantage of a diversity of investments and professional asset management.

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 63% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

She has a $195 capital gain on the sale. The answer is figured as follows:
Starting basis 	$1,275
Minus nontaxable distribution 	($250)
Basis after distribution 	$1,025
Sale price 	$1,220
Gain 	$195

Since she held the stock for less than a year, it would be treated as a short-term gain. (Based on a prior EA exam question).

21. Question ID: 94849678 (Topic: Capital Gains and Losses)

Five years ago, Edwin bought 500 shares of Ramses Company stock for $1,500. He paid a broker's commission of $110 on the transaction. On July 15, 2023, Ramses Co. distributed a nontaxable stock dividend of 100 additional shares. On December 25, 2023, Edwin sold all his Ramses Co. stock for a total of $2,000. What is the nature and the amount of his gain on all the shares he sold?

    A. Long-term capital gain of $317; short-term gain of $183.
    B. Long-term capital gain of $273; short-term gain of $117.
    C. Long-term capital gain of $500.
    D. Long-term capital gain of $390.correct

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 70% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Although Edwin owned the 100 shares he received as a nontaxable stock dividend for less than one year, all the stock has a long-term holding period. He bought the stock for $1,500 plus a $110 broker’s commission, so his basis in the stock is $1,610. He sold it for $2,000 more than a year later, so he has a long-term capital gain of $390 on the sale of the 600 shares. The answer is calculated as follows:

($1,500 purchase price + $110 broker’s fee) = $1,610 basis
($2,000 sale price - $1,610 basis) = $390 long-term capital gain

Note: Although Edwin owned the 100 shares he received as a nontaxable stock dividend for less than one year, all the stock has a long-term holding period. It is because stock splits or stock dividends generally have the same holding period as the original stock.
