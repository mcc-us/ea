A. Antiques
B. Comic books
C. Cryptocurrency

Artwork
Rugs or antiques,
Precious metals or gemstones,

For IRS purposes, what activity qualifies a person as a stockbroker or bona-fide 'securities dealer'?
A. A taxpayer engaged in the trade or business of selling securities.
B. A taxpayer who reports income and loss on Schedule E.
C. A taxpayer who engages in the business of professional gambling.
D. A person who purchases securities for personal investment.
","A:
IRC Sec. 475 defines a 'securities dealer' or 'stockbroker', as a taxpayer who regularly purchases and sells securities (such as stocks and bonds) in the ordinary course of a trade or business. A stockbroker is unique; unlike other taxpayers who purchase and sell securities, a securities dealer is a taxpayer engaged in the trade or business of selling securities. Because a securities dealer holds securities for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, such securities are not considered capital assets; therefore, the gain or loss is treated as ordinary gain or loss, NOT a capital gain or loss. A self-employed securities dealer must make a special election called the 'Mark-to-Market' election, and then report their income or loss on Schedule C (not Schedule D). The IRS discusses Securities Dealers in Tax Topic 429, Traders in Securities.

On January 1, Geneva paid $10,000 for 100 shares of stock in Agri-Barn, Inc. a start-up company. Six months after she bought it, she sold the stock to her brother, Henry, for $8,000, which was its current market value. Two months later, the stock suddenly shoots up in value, and on December 31, Henry sells all the stock to an unrelated party for $16,000. What gain or loss should Geneva and Henry recognize on their tax returns in the year of sale?
A. Geneva recognizes $2,000 capital loss; Henry recognizes $7,000 capital gain.
B. Geneva recognizes $0 capital loss; Henry recognizes $8,000 capital gain.
C. Geneva recognizes $0 capital loss; Henry recognizes $6,000 capital gain.
D. Geneva recognizes $2,000 capital loss; Henry recognizes $8,000 capital gain.
","C:
This is a related party transaction, and special rules apply. Geneva recognizes $0 capital loss; Henry recognizes $6,000 capital gain. This is because Geneva cannot claim a loss on the sale of stock to her own brother. Losses from sale or exchange of property, directly or indirectly, are disallowed between related parties. When the property is later sold to an unrelated party, any previously disallowed loss may be used to offset gain on that transaction. However, since Henry sold the stock at a profit, he would be able to use the basis of the original seller (his sister's basis was $10,000, this is called a 'transferred basis') in order to calculate his own gain on the sale.

C. $2,100 long-term capital gain and $2,100 short-term capital gain.
D. $5,400 long-term capital gain.
","A:
A stock dividend does not increase basis. Instead, the original basis of the stock is spread over the additional shares. Stock acquired in a stock dividend or stock split has the same holding period as the original stock owned. Since Malila's original stock has a long-term holding period, the stock she received in a stock dividend also has a long-term holding period and all of her gain is long-term. The answer is calculated as follows:
"  "0 shares × $4 per share = $1,200 (taxpayer’s basis before stock dividend)
"  "0 shares × $2 per share = $1,200 (taxpayer’s basis after stock dividend)

Capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely during a taxpayer's lifetime. However, capital loss carryovers do expire upon a taxpayer's death. The losses do not carryover to the taxpayer's estate, because the decedent and estate are treated as separate tax entities. To learn more about capital gains and losses, see IRS Topic No. 409 Capital Gains and Losses.

Sasha and Noreen are married and file jointly. Their combined wages totaled $75,000, and they had the following transactions in the current year:
Sold 100 shares of Ellison Corporation stock for $5,000. They had purchased the shares ten years ago for $14,000.
Sold 50 shares of Martinez Company stock for $7,500. They had purchased the shares two years ago for $3,000.
They had no other capital asset transactions during the year. How should they handle these transactions on their tax return?
A. They can claim a loss of $3,000 in the current year and carry forward the remaining $6,000 loss. They must report a long-term gain of $4,500 on their current year tax return.
B. They must report a long-term gain of $4,500 on their current year tax return. Stock losses are not deductible.
C. They have a long-term loss of $4,500 that they can claim in the current year. Since they file jointly, their capital loss deduction is up to $6,000 per year.
D. They can claim a loss of $3,000 in the current year and carry forward the remaining $1,500 loss.
","D:
The answer is calculated as follows: The Ellison Corporation stock loss of $9,000 ($14,000 minus $5,000) is netted against the Martinez Company stock gain of $4,500 ($7,500 minus $3,000), for a net long-term capital loss of $4,500. A taxpayer can deduct up to $3,000 ($1,500 for MFS) of net capital losses against ordinary income in a tax year. (Taxpayers filing jointly are also limited to a $3,000 deduction.) They can carry forward the remaining $1,500 loss ($4,500 loss minus $3,000). Any excess capital loss can be carried over for an unlimited time until it is used up. A capital loss carried over to a later tax year retains its long-term or short-term character. A short-term capital loss carryover first offsets short-term gain in the carryover year. If a net short-term capital loss results, this loss offsets long-term capital gain. Any remaining net loss can then be used to offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income.

Kandy received a 1099-DIV showing a $180 capital gain distribution from her mutual fund investment. However, she never sold any of her mutual fund shares during the year. What is the most likely scenario for this event?
A. This is a nontaxable event. The amount lowers her basis in her shares. 
B. This is obvious securities fraud and she should file a police report.
C. The 1099-DIV is likely incorrect, and the income is not taxable.
D. This is a taxable capital gain and generally must be reported on Schedule D.
","D:
This is a taxable capital gain and generally must be reported on Schedule D. The taxpayer owns shares in the mutual fund, but the fund owns capital assets, such as shares of stock, corporate bonds, government obligations, etc. One of the ways the fund makes money is to sell these assets at a gain. A mutual fund is a regulated investment company that pools funds of investors allowing them to take advantage of a diversity of investments and professional asset management.

Five years ago, Edwin bought 500 shares of Ramses Company stock for $1,500. He paid a broker's commission of $110 on the transaction. On July 15, 2023, Ramses Co. distributed a nontaxable stock dividend of 100 additional shares. On December 25, 2023, Edwin sold all his Ramses Co. stock for a total of $2,000. What is the nature and the amount of his gain on all the shares he sold?
A. Long-term capital gain of $317; short-term gain of $183.
B. Long-term capital gain of $273; short-term gain of $117.
C. Long-term capital gain of $500.
D. Long-term capital gain of $390.
","D:
Although Edwin owned the 100 shares he received as a nontaxable stock dividend for less than one year, all the stock has a long-term holding period. He bought the stock for $1,500 plus a $110 broker’s commission, so his basis in the stock is $1,610. He sold it for $2,000 more than a year later, so he has a long-term capital gain of $390 on the sale of the 600 shares. The answer is calculated as follows:
($1,500 purchase price + $110 broker’s fee) = $1,610 basis
($2,000 sale price - $1,610 basis) = $390 long-term capital gain
Note: Although Edwin owned the 100 shares he received as a nontaxable stock dividend for less than one year, all the stock has a long-term holding period. It is because stock splits or stock dividends generally have the same holding period as the original stock. Please see IRS Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses, for more information about stock transactions.

"Peggy sold two acres of land to her brother, Zeke on January 1. She realized a gain of $50,000 on the sale. Zeke agreed to pay her in five annual installments, and Peggy treats the sale as an installment sale. On November 1, eleven months after he purchased the land, Zeke sold the land to another person. Zeke plans to keep making installment payments based on their original agreement. How does this sale affect Peggy?
A. The installment sale method is disallowed to Peggy, and Peggy must report the entire gain of $50,000 on the sale, even though she has not received all the installment payments.
B. The new sale invalidates the earlier sale and Peggy will not have to report any gain.
C. There is no effect to Peggy from Zeke's sale of the land to another party.
D. Both Zeke and Peggy will face IRS penalties for selling the land before the required two-year holding period for installment sales between related persons.
","A:
Installment sales to related persons are generally allowed. However, if a taxpayer sells property to a related person who then subsequently, the buyer sells or disposes of the property within two years of the original sale, the original seller will lose the benefit of installment sale reporting. Peggy must report the entire gain of $50,000, even though she has not received all of the installment payments.

"Mario sells a plot of farmland to his friend Natalie. The farmland has a basis of $70,000 and he sold it to Natalie for $140,000. Mario's gross profit is $70,000. Rather than using a bank loan, Mario offers to carry the note for Natalie, the buyer. Mario receives a $28,000 down payment on June 1, 2023, from Natalie, as well as a notarized buyer’s note for $112,000. The note provides for four annual payments of $28,000 plus 7% interest. Exclusive of the interest income, what amount must Mario report as taxable gain in 2023?
A. $0
B. $14,000
C. $8,750
D. $17,500
","B:
This is an installment sale. In this example, Mario’s gross profit percentage on the sale is 50% ($70,000 ÷ $140,000). He must report as his installment gain this same percentage of each $28,000 payment received ($28,000 × 50% = $14,000). In each year a taxpayer receives a payment related to an installment sale, he must report the interest income and the applicable portion of his gain on the sale. The taxpayer does not include in income the part that is the return of his basis in the property. This is the 'installment sale method' of recognizing income.
Note: The “installment sale method” for reporting taxable income on an installment sale only applies when the taxpayer has a gain on the sale of the property. It does not apply when the taxpayer sells property at a loss. For more information about installment sales, see IRS Publication 537, Installment Sales.

"Eveline sells a condo to her friend, Fred, for $200,000. Her basis was $150,000 and her gross profit is $50,000. Instead of using a lender, Eveline carries the note for her friend, and will receive five annual payments of $40,000, plus interest, until the note is paid off. She receives the first principal payment of $40,000 from Fred on December 30, 2023 She wants to use the installment method to report income from the sale. What is the amount of installment sale income that Eveline must report in the current year?
A. $10,000
B. $0
C. $8,000
D. $40,000
","A:
This is an example of an installment sale. Eveline's gross profit percentage is 25% ($50,000 annual payments ÷ $200,000 sales price). Eveline would report 25% of each principal payment, (25% × $40,000) = $10,000, as installment sale income from the sale for the tax year she receives the payment (after subtracting interest, if any). The balance of each payment, exclusive of interest, is the tax-free return of her adjusted basis.
Note: The 'installment method' only applies when a taxpayer has a gain on the sale. If the taxpayer incurs a loss on the sale, the installment method does not apply. For more information, see IRS Publication 537, Installment Sales.

","C:This is an installment sale. Cassie’s overall gross profit is $50,000 ($200,000 selling price - $150,000 adjusted basis), and her gross profit percentage is 25% ($50,000 ÷ $200,000). She must report 25% of each payment received (excluding the portion representing interest income) as gain from the sale. Thus, $12,500 (25% of the $50,000 down payment) is taxable in the current year. See IRS Publication 537, Installment Sales."
