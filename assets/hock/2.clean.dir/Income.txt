    C. Vacation pay
    D. Worker's compensation correct

However, worker's compensation is not treated as wages, and is not taxable. Worker's compensation should not be confused with disability insurance, sick pay, or unemployment compensation; it is a type of benefit that pays workers who are injured on the job.
