3. Question ID: 94815858 (Topic: Taxable Alimony)
Belinda is married to Jesse. They are both US citizens and live in Montana, a non-community property state. They have no children. Because of financial problems caused by her first husband, Belinda refuses to file a joint return with anyone, including Jesse. Belinda files her own tax return separately. Belinda receives her W-2 from her employer. She earned $83,000 from her job. She also receives Form 1099-INT from her credit union, reporting $357 in interest earned on her savings account. She also paid $5,000 in alimony to her ex-husband, who she divorced in 2015. She has no other income or adjustments. Based on this information, what is her AGI?
A. $78,000
B. $83,000
C. $83,357
D. $78,357
D:
Her AGI (adjusted gross income) is $78,357, figured as follows:
$83,000 Wages +
$357 Interest income
$83,357 (this is Belinda's 'gross income')
-$5,000 Alimony paid (this is an adjustment to income)
=$78,357 AGI
Note: Belinda's gross income includes her wages, interest, capital gains, income from retirement accounts. This total is then adjusted downward by specific deductions (including alimony paid) to arrive at AGI, or 'adjusted gross income.' Under the TCJA, an individual whose divorce was finalized in 2019 and pays alimony to an ex-spouse will no longer be able to deduct those payments. However, any divorce decree that was finalized before 2019 is considered “grandfathered” which means that those alimony payments remain deductible to the payor. Since Belinda's divorce was finalized in 2015, her decree is considered 'grandfathered' and her alimony payments are still deductible.

1. Question ID: 94849607 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Kendra bought a new car for $30,000. She made a $5,000 down payment and borrowed the remaining $25,000 from her bank via a recourse loan. After she stopped making payments, the bank repossessed the car. The balance due on the loan at the time of the repossession was $15,000. The FMV of the car when repossessed was $12,000. She later receives a 1099-C for the canceled debt. She was not insolvent when the debt was canceled, because she has $40,000 in a traditional IRA account. What amount is Kendra’s loss and what amount must she report as cancellation of debt income?
A. $15,000 nondeductible loss; $12,000 COD.
B. $13,000 deductible loss; $0 COD.
C. $18,000 nondeductible loss; $3,000 COD.
D. $13,000 nondeductible loss; $3,000 COD.
C:
A taxpayer is personally liable for a recourse loan. Since a repossession is treated as a sale, the gain or loss must be computed. Kendra compares the amount realized ($12,000) with her adjusted basis ($30,000) in the vehicle to determine that she has an $18,000 nondeductible loss. She also has ordinary income from cancellation of debt. That income is $3,000 ($15,000 canceled debt − $12,000 FMV). Kendra must report the canceled debt as income on her Form 1040.

A. Nonrecourse loans
B. Mortgage loans
C. Recourse loans

5. Question ID: 94850120 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Isaac has canceled debt from a foreclosure on his vacation home. The mortgage on the property was a recourse debt. What does this mean?
A. A recourse debt means that the debt is unsecured.
B. It means that the lender cannot pursue anything other than the collateral.
C. A recourse debt means that Isaac is personally liable for the loan.
D. A recourse debt means that Issac must file a civil action.
C:
A recourse debt holds the borrower personally liable. This means that Isaac is personally liable for the mortgage. All other debt is considered nonrecourse. A nonrecourse debt (loan) does not allow the lender to pursue anything other than the collateral. For example, if a borrower defaults on a nonrecourse home loan, the bank can only foreclose on the home. The bank generally cannot take further legal action to collect the money owed on the debt. Whether a debt is recourse or nonrecourse may depend on state law.
6. Question ID: 94849728 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Joel’s primary residence is subject to a $320,000 mortgage debt. His basis in the home is $340,000. Joel loses his job and is unable to make his mortgage payments, so his bank forecloses on the home on January 10, 2023. Due to declining real estate values in his city, Joel's former residence is sold for $280,000 on December 15, 2023, as a short-sale. The debt was canceled by the mortgage lender and Joel receives a Form 1099-C reporting the cancellation. Joel was not insolvent at the time. What amount of taxable income from cancellation of debt must Joel report on his tax return?
A. $0
B. $60,000
C. $40,000
D. $30,000
A:
Joel has $40,000 of cancelled debt from the discharge of indebtedness. However, none of the canceled debt is taxable to Joel because it is excluded from income because it is primary residence indebtedness. Qualified principal residence indebtedness can be excluded from income. Generally, if a taxpayer excludes canceled debt from income, the taxpayer must attach Form 982, Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness, to report the amount of debt qualifying for exclusion. To learn more about cancellation of debt, see IRS Topic No. 431, Canceled Debt.

When Danny and June married five years ago, June's parents loaned them $30,000 for a down payment on their first house. Danny and June made regular payments on the loan until June's parents were killed in an accident in 2023. When they died, Danny and June still owed $17,500 on the balance of the loan. One of the terms of June's parents’ will was that any balance remaining on the loan would be forgiven at their death and would be considered a gift. How should this be reported on Danny and June's joint tax return?
A. Danny and June do not have to recognize income due to the forgiveness of the debt. No reporting is required.
B. Danny and June do not have to recognize income due to the forgiveness of the debt, but they are required to file a gift tax return.
C. Danny and June have to recognize income due to the forgiveness of the debt, but only the amount above the gift limit.
D. Danny and June have to recognize $17,500 in income due to the forgiveness of the debt.
A:
Danny and June do not have to recognize income due to the forgiveness of the debt. No reporting is required. Loans forgiven as gifts are not taxed. If a debt is canceled by a private lender, such as a relative or friend, and the cancellation is intended as a gift, there is no income that has to be reported. Danny and June are not required to file gift tax returns, because any gift tax reporting is always done by the donor (not the donee, or the recipient of the gift).
12. Question ID: 94849513 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Janine had $5,000 of credit card debt, which she did not pay. She received a Form 1099-C from her credit card company showing canceled debt of $5,000 at the end of the year.

A. $2,000
B. $0
C. $5,000
D. $7,000
B:
At the time the debt was canceled, Janine was insolvent to the extent of $8,000 ($15,000 total debt minus $7,000 FMV of her total assets). She can exclude the entire $5,000 canceled debt from income. She must file Form 982 to report the canceled debt, and she should mark the box for insolvency.
13. Question ID: 94815960 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Canceled debt is generally taxable, but there are several exclusions from the general rule for reporting canceled debt as income. Which of the following types of canceled debt would NOT qualify for exclusion in 2023?
A. Discharge of debt through bankruptcy.
B. Discharge of qualified principal residence indebtedness.
C. Recourse debt on a car that was repossessed by a lender.
D. Discharge of debt of insolvent taxpayer.
C:
The recourse debt on a vehicle would likely be taxable canceled debt. If a lender forecloses on property subject to a recourse debt and cancels the portion of the debt in excess of the fair market value (FMV) of the property, the canceled portion of the debt is treated as ordinary income from cancellation of indebtedness. This amount must be included in gross income unless it qualifies for an exception or exclusion. The exclusions are:
Discharge of debt through bankruptcy.
Discharge of debt of insolvent taxpayer.
Discharge of qualified farm indebtedness.
Discharge of qualified real property business indebtedness.
Discharge of qualified principal residence indebtedness.

15. Question ID: 95003697 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Shane fell on hard times and stopped paying his mortgage in the prior year. His home was later foreclosed. At the time of foreclosure, he owed a balance of $190,000 to the lender and the FMV of the property was $150,000 at the time of the foreclosure. For tax purposes, the foreclosure is treated as a sale. Shane's mortgage loan was nonrecourse. Based on this information, what would the 'sale price' be for reporting this transaction?
A. The sale price would be $0.
B. The sale price would be $150,000.
C. The sale price would be $40,000.
D. The sale price would be $190,000.
D:
Since Shane is not personally liable for the debt (a nonrecourse loan), the 'selling price' would be $190,000. Nonrecourse debt is satisfied by the surrender of the secured property regardless of the FMV at the time of surrender, and the borrower is not personally liable for the debt. If property that is subject to nonrecourse debt is abandoned, foreclosed upon, subject of a short sale, or repossessed by the lender, the circumstances are treated as a sale of the property by the taxpayer. In determining the gain or loss on the disposition of the property, the balance of the non-recourse debt at the time of the disposition of the property is included in the amount realized (generally the selling price). Since Shane is not personally liable for the debt, the difference between the FMV of the property and the balance of the loan is not included in his gross income (see detailed example in Publication 4491).

7. Question ID: 94849659 (Topic: Taxation of Court Awards and Damages)
Heidi, age 22, suffered major physical injuries after a serious car accident. The auto manufacturer was found negligent for having faulty equipment installed on her car. A jury awarded Heidi the following damages from the lawsuit:
$750,000 for physical injuries
$200,000 for emotional distress as a direct result of the injuries
$1 million for punitive damages against the auto manufacturer for faulty equipment
What amount of the damages is taxable to Heidi?
A. $1 million
B. $1,200,000
C. $1,950,000
D. $200,000
A:
Only the punitive damages are taxable. Settlements for personal physical injuries or physical illness are not taxable. Damages received for emotional distress due to physical injury or sickness are treated the same way as damages for physical injury or sickness, so they are not included in income. If emotional distress is not due to a physical injury (for example, an employment lawsuit in which a taxpayer suffers emotional distress for injury to reputation), the proceeds are taxable, except for any damages received for medical care due to that emotional distress. Emotional distress includes physical symptoms such as headaches, insomnia, and stomach disorders.

C. When the individual for whom the account was established dies.
D. When the individual for whom the account was established reaches age 24, or dies, whichever is earlier.
A:
Coverdell ESA is a type of educational savings account set up exclusively for the purpose of paying qualified education expenses for the designated beneficiary. However, the funds in a Coverdell cannot remain in the account forever. Generally, the balance in a Coverdell ESA must be distributed within 30 days after the individual for whom the account was established reaches age 30, or dies, whichever is earlier. The treatment of the Coverdell ESA at the death of an individual under age 30 depends on who acquires the interest in the account.

10. Question ID: 94850056 (Topic: Tax-Free Education Assistance (including Coverdell))
When Lonnie was born, three separate Coverdell Education Savings Accounts were set up for him: one by his parents, one by his grandmother, and one by his uncle. In 2023, what is the maximum amount of contributions that can be made to Lonnie’s Coverdell ESA accounts?
A. $1,000 per each account.
B. $2,000 total in all three accounts combined.
C. $2,000 per each account.
D. $6,000 total in all three accounts combined.
B:
In 2023, the total amount of contributions to all Coverdell ESA’s for one designated beneficiary cannot be more than $2,000. So, for instance, if Lonnie’s parents contribute $1,000 to his account and his grandmother contributes $800, his uncle could contribute no more than $200, for a combined total of $2,000. If more than $2,000 is contributed to the accounts, it is considered an excess contribution. If an excess contribution is made, then the penalty is imposed on the beneficiary (the child). The beneficiary must pay a 6% excise tax each year on excess contributions that are in a Coverdell ESA at the end of the year if the amount is not corrected or withdrawn.

Generally, the interest earned on US savings bonds is taxable. If a taxpayer does not include the interest in income in the years it is earned, he must include it in his income in the year in which he cashes in the bonds. However, when a taxpayer cashes in qualified Series EE savings bonds, he does not have to include in his income some or all of the interest earned on the bonds if he meets the following conditions:
He pays qualified education expenses for himself, his spouse, or a dependent for which he can claim an exemption on his tax return.
His MAGI is less than the amount specified for his filing status.
His filing status is not married filing separately.
A qualified US savings bond is a series EE bond issued after 1989 or a series I bond. The bond must be issued in the taxpayer’s name (as the sole owner) or in the names of he and his spouse (as co-owners). The owner must be at least 24 years old before the bond’s issue date.

B. Kimberly uses the $10,000 for tuition and fees at a private Christian University.
C. Kimberly uses the $10,000 for an apprenticeship program to be a dental technician.
D. Kimberly uses the $10,000 for travel and expenses of being a missionary in a qualified religious organization.
D:
The $10,000 for travel and expenses of being a missionary in a qualified religious organization would not be a qualifying expense. A 529 plan is also called a Qualified Tuition Program. It is an investment account that offers tax benefits when used to pay for qualified education expenses for a designated beneficiary. Withdrawals from education savings plan accounts can generally be used at any college or university. Education savings plans can also be used to pay up to $10,000 per year per beneficiary for tuition at any public, private or religious elementary or secondary school (K-12). In 2019, student loan payments and costs of apprenticeship programs were added as qualified education expenses.
However, if 529 account withdrawals are not used for qualified education expenses, they will be subject to state and federal income taxes and an additional 10% federal tax penalty on earnings. Learn more about 529 plans, see IRS Topic No. 313 Qualified Tuition Programs (QTPs).

D. $10,500
D:
Vinita can exclude the full $8,000 of the fellowship and $2,500 of the scholarship. The $3,000 portion of the scholarship that is designated for her teaching is taxable income, because it is compensation for teaching two classes. A scholarship or fellowship is tax-free only if it meets all of the following requirements:
The taxpayer must be a degree candidate at an eligible educational institution that has been nationally accredited.
It does not exceed qualified educational expenses.
It is not designated for other purposes, such as room and board.
It does not represent payment for teaching, research, or other services.

The child support payments and the food stamp benefits are not taxable. The legal fees would be deductible as an adjustment to income, but she still must report the entire gross amount of the settlement. The gambling losses do not affect the inclusion of the gambling income within gross income. However, if Lisa chooses to itemize deductions, her gambling losses may be deducted on Schedule A to the extent of her gambling income. If Ginny does not itemize, the gambling losses are not deductible.

A. Unemployment compensation is taxable unless the taxpayer is disabled.
B. Unemployment compensation must be included in a taxpayer's gross income.
C. Unemployment compensation is taxable to the state, but not to federal.
D. Unemployment compensation is not taxable.
B:
Any unemployment compensation received must be included in a taxpayer's gross income. Unemployment compensation is always taxable, regardless of the taxpayer's situation. Unemployment compensation generally includes any amounts received under the unemployment compensation laws of the US or of a state. It includes state unemployment insurance benefits and benefits paid to you by a state or the District of Columbia from the Federal Unemployment Trust Fund. It also includes railroad unemployment compensation benefits, but NOT worker's compensation. Worker's compensation (often called 'worker's comp') is not taxable to the recipient.
3. Question ID: 94849650 (Topic: Taxable Government Benefits)
Vitally fell ill after a chemical accident that occurred at his work. After the accident, he left his job and received several types of benefit payments during the year. Which of the following would be taxable to Vitally?
A. $12,700 in unemployment compensation.
B. $10,000 in worker's compensation.
C. $500 monthly payments received under an accident insurance policy (Vitally paid the premiums on the policy).
D. A $32,000 legal settlement for physical sickness from his former employer.
A:
Vitally must report the $12,700 in unemployment compensation, because unemployment compensation is always taxable. Worker's compensation is not taxable. Legal settlements for personal physical injuries or physical sickness are non-taxable. If a taxpayer pays the premiums on an accident or health insurance policy, the benefits later received under the policy aren’t taxable. See IRS Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information.

8. Question ID: 94849602 (Topic: Taxable Government Benefits)
Trina cares for her disabled son in her home. She receives Qualified Medicaid waiver payments from the government totaling $17,000 during the year. She received a Form 1099-NEC reporting these payments as non-employee compensation. She does not care for anyone else, other than her son, and does not have any other employment. How should these amounts be reported on Trina's tax return?
A. She should report the amounts as 'other income' on Form 1040. 
B. The amounts are not taxable. In order to offset the income that was reported to her on 1099-NEC, Trina should report the amount of those payments as income on Schedule C and also report the excludable amount as a Schedule C expense.
C. She should report the amounts on Schedule C and deduct any related business expenses. 
D. She should report the amounts as royalty payments on Schedule E. 
B:
The amounts are not taxable. Qualified Medicaid waiver payments are treated as 'difficulty of care' payments and are excludable from gross income. These are payments generally issued by the state.
If the taxpayer received Qualified Medicaid waiver payments as described in IRS Notice 2014-7, they may receive a Form 1099-MISC, 1099-NEC, or even a Form W-2 reporting the payments as non-employee compensation. 
IRS Notice 2014-7 addresses the income tax treatment of certain payments to an individual care provider under a state Home and Community-Based Services Waiver (Medicaid waiver) program. The notice provides that 'qualified Medicaid waiver payments' as difficulty-of-care payments are excludable from gross income. If the taxpayer chooses to exclude the payments received from gross income, the IRS suggests reporting the amount of those payments as income on Schedule C and also report the excludable amount as a Schedule C expense (this question is based on an example in the IRS' VITA courseware). Most software programs now have an override to ease reporting for this type of income. 
6. Question ID: 94849711 (Topic: Taxable Government Benefits)
Supplemental wages are compensation paid in addition to an employee’s regular wages. They do not include payments for:
A. Payments for non-deductible moving expenses.
B. Retroactive wage increases.
C. Accumulated sick leave.
D. Worker's compensation.
D:
Supplemental wages are compensation paid to an employee in addition to regular wages and include, but are not limited to, bonuses, commissions, overtime pay, accumulated sick leave, severance pay, retroactive wage increases, and payments for non-deductible moving expenses. Worker's compensation is not taxable to the recipient at the state or federal level.

D. The food stamps and utility bill assistance are non-taxable. The unemployment compensation is taxable.
D:
Both the food stamps and utility bill assistance are considered non-taxable. Unemployment compensation is taxable for IRS purposes.
1. Question ID: 94850381 (Topic: Hobby Income)
A key feature of a business is that people do it to make a profit. People engage in a hobby for sport or recreation, not to make a profit. The IRS presumes that an activity is carried on for profit if it:
A. Makes a profit during at least 3 of the last 7 tax years, including the previous year.
B. Makes a profit during at least 3 of the last 5 tax years, including the current year.
C. Makes a profit during at least 3 of the last 10 tax years, including the current year.
D. Makes a profit during at least 2 of the last 5 tax years, including the previous year.
B:
The IRS presumes that an activity is “carried on for profit” if it makes a profit during at least 3 of the last 5 tax years, including the current year. The general rule is 2 of the last 7 years for activities that consist primarily of breeding, showing, training or racing horses. The hobby loss rules apply to individuals, S corporations, trusts, estates, and partnerships but not to C corporations. 
2. Question ID: 94850408 (Topic: Hobby Income)
The hobby loss rules do not apply to which of the following entity types?
A. Trusts.
B. C Corporations.
C. S Corporations.
D. Individuals.
B:
The hobby loss rules apply to individuals, partners in a partnership, estates, trusts, and shareholders of S corporations. The hobby loss rules do not apply to C corporations. In other words, the 'hobby loss' rules of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) §183 attempt to curb perceived loss deduction abuses by activities that are not entered into for profit.
4. Question ID: 758501777 (Topic: Hobby Income)

6. Question ID: 94849502 (Topic: Hobby Income)
The IRS presumes that an activity is 'carried on for profit' if it makes a profit for:
A. Two years in a row.
B. Three of the last five tax years, including the current year.
C. Three years in a row.
D. Two of the last three tax years, including the current year.
B:
The IRS presumes that an activity is carried on for profit if it makes a profit during at least three of the last five tax years, including the current year. In the case of breeding, showing, training, or racing horses, at least two of the last seven years must show a profit. If an activity is later determined to not be for profit, the losses from that activity may be disallowed. This happens when the IRS reclassifies a business as a hobby.
See the IRS detail page on how to distinguish between a business and a hobby.
7. Question ID: 94850351 (Topic: Hobby Income)
Which of the following activities would be classified as a hobby activity (rather than a business)?
A. A rental activity that is profitable but one in which the taxpayer does not materially participate. 
B. An activity that is carried on primarily for pleasure and recreation and occasionally turns a profit. 
C. A new business activity that incurs a net operating loss in the current year. 
D. A business activity that is carried on to make a profit but incurs losses for multiple years. 
B:
An activity must have a profit motive in order to be considered a business. A key feature of a business is that people do it to make a profit. People engage in a hobby for sport or recreation, not to make a profit. See the IRS detail page on hobby activities for more information. 
3. Question ID: 94849577 (Topic: Hobby Income)
Morty works full-time as a lifeguard. He is also a competitive surfer and has regularly participated in surfing competitions for the past six years with the intent to earn prize winnings. He has devoted significant time and effort to developing expertise in surfing, and he keeps good records that track his income and expenses associated with the surfing competitions. Morty has not yet earned a profit through the surfing competitions. As his tax preparer, what would you advise Morty?
A. The surfing competitions constitute a business activity, so he can report his income and deduct his expenses on Schedule C.
B. Morty does not have to claim any of the surfing competition income, but he is allowed to capitalize the expenses to a future year, for when he starts to make a profit. 
C. Morty can choose to forego claiming the income and the expenses, since the activity is just a hobby.
D. Morty is likely engaging in a hobby. His hobby-related expenses are not deductible, but his hobby income is taxable. 
D:
The IRS is likely to determine that Morty is engaging in a hobby and the surfing competitions are not a true business activity engaged in for profit. Although he maintains adequate records and enters surf competitions with the intent to earn money, he continues to enter competitions despite sustaining losses over several years, suggesting the lack of a true profit motive. A hobby is an activity typically undertaken primarily for pleasure. The IRS presumes that an activity is “carried on for a profit” if it makes a profit during at least three of the last five tax years, including the current year. Income from a hobby is taxable and reported on Form 1040 as “other income”. Expenses related to a hobby activity are no longer deductible due to changes implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

5. Question ID: 758501776 (Topic: Hobby Income)
Aishwarya has a hobby making baskets out of yarn and other crafting materials. She sells the baskets for $35 each at craft fairs sometimes, but mostly she just gives them out to family and friends as gifts. This year, she earned $1,200 from selling her baskets, and she spent $250 on materials to make the baskets. How much net income should she report from her hobby activity, and how should the income be reported?
A. She should report $950 on Schedule C of her individual tax return.
B. She should report the full amount of $1,200 on Schedule C. None of her expenses are deductible, because it is a hobby.
C. She should report the full amount of $1,200 as 'other income' on Schedule 1 of her individual tax return.
D. She should report $950 as 'other income' on Schedule 1 of her individual tax return. 
D:
Aishwarya should report $950 ($1,200 - $250) as 'other income' on Schedule 1 of her individual tax return. Income earned from a hobby must be reported on Form 1040, Schedule 1. This form is used to report additional income, such as hobby income, that is not reported on other forms.
Note: Expenses related to a hobby are not deductible, however, a taxpayer can deduct Cost of Goods Sold from gross receipts to calculate hobby income. Since Aishwarya spent $250 on supplies to actually build her baskets, these would be classified as COGS, and therefore deductible from her gross receipts to arrive at her taxable hobby income.

A. Whether the taxpayer has attempted similar activities in the past
B. Whether the taxpayer depends on income from the activity for their livelihood
C. Whether the taxpayer enjoys the activity
D. Whether the taxpayer has a bona fide intent to make a profit

1. Question ID: 94849629 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Which of the following would be considered 'passive activity' income?
A. Portfolio income.
B. Alaska Permanent Fund dividends.
C. Rental income received by a taxpayer who is not a real estate professional.
D. Cancellation of debt income.
C:
Generally, a passive activity is any rental activity OR any business in which the taxpayer does not materially participate. Nonpassive activities are businesses in which the taxpayer works on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis. Passive activity income also does NOT include:
Portfolio income, such as interest, dividends, annuities, and royalties not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business, or gain or loss from the disposition of property that produces these types of income or that is held for investment.
Personal service income. This includes salaries, wages, commissions, self-employment income from trade or business activities in which the taxpayer materially participated, deferred compensation, taxable Social Security and other retirement benefits, and payments from partnerships to partners for personal services.
Any income from intangible property, such as a patent, copyright, or literary, musical, or artistic composition, if the taxpayer’s personal efforts significantly contributed to the creation of the property.
State, local, and foreign income tax refunds.
Income from a covenant not to compete.
Alaska Permanent Fund dividends.
Cancellation of debt income, if at the time the debt is discharged, the debt is not allocated to passive activities.
To learn more about passive activity income, refer to Publication 925, Passive Activities and At-Risk Rules.
2. Question ID: 94849567 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Serenity owns a condo in Hawaii. She lives in the home most of the year and uses it as her primary residence. While she was away visiting friends, she rented her condo for 13 days, charging $100 per day for a total of $1,300. She also had $320 of expenses during that time. How should this rental income be reported?
A. She should report the income as ordinary income on Form 1040. The expenses are deductible as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A, if she itemizes deductions.
B. She should report all the rental income. She can deduct $320 of expenses on Schedule E.
C. The income is not taxable and does not need to be reported. The expenses are not deductible. 
D. She can deduct the expenses. The rental income is not taxable.
C:
She does not report any of the income or expenses based on the exception for minimal rental use. If a taxpayer rents a main home or vacation home for fewer than 15 days, she does not have to recognize any of the income as taxable. She also cannot deduct any rental expenses. This is called the “15-day rule” or “minimal rental use”. For more examples, refer to Publication 527, Residential Rental Property.
3. Question ID: 95033973 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Roque, who is single, owns a rental duplex. He actively participates in the rental activity by collecting rent and performing repairs, but he is not a real estate professional. In the current year, Roque had a loss of $29,000 on this rental activity on Schedule E. He had no other passive income. His income from wages was $90,000. How much of the rental loss can Roque deduct on his current year tax return?
A. $4,000
B. $29,000
C. $25,000
D. $0
C:
Roque can deduct $25,000 of rental losses. The remaining amount, $4,000 ($29,000 - $25,000), can be carried over to the following year. A special rule allows taxpayers deduct up to $25,000 of rental losses from rental real estate activities in which they actively participate. This “special allowance” is an exception to the general rule disallowing losses in excess of income from passive activities. The $25,000 deduction is phased out when a taxpayer’s MAGI is from $100,000 to $150,000 and phased out completely when a taxpayer's MAGI is over $150,000.
5. Question ID: 94849517 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Fantine owns a residential rental property in addition to her primary residence. She pays mortgage interest and property taxes on both properties and receives a separate Form 1098 for each. How should this mortgage interest be reported on her individual tax return?
A. The mortgage interest and taxes for both properties should be listed as an adjustment to income on Form 1040.
B. The mortgage interest and taxes for the rental property should be listed as rental expenses on Schedule E, and the mortgage interest and taxes for the primary residence should be listed on Schedule A as itemized deductions.
C. The mortgage interest and taxes for both properties should be listed as itemized deductions on Schedule A.
D. The mortgage interest for the rental property should be listed on Schedule E. The mortgage interest for the primary residence and the property taxes for both properties should be listed on Schedule A.
B:
Fantine needs to report the mortgage interest and taxes that she paid on two separate schedules. The mortgage interest and taxes for the rental property should be listed on Schedule E. Rental income is reported on Schedule E and is offset by various deductions, including mortgage interest and property taxes paid. The mortgage interest and taxes for the primary residence should be listed on Schedule A as an itemized deduction.
6. Question ID: 98939195 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Eduardo owns an interest in three limited partnerships. He is only an investor (a limited partner) and has no involvement in the running of the business. One of the partnerships is profitable, and the other two are not profitable. Eduardo also earned $36,000 in wages from a part-time job. Based on these figures, calculate Eduardo's passive loss carryover on his individual return.
Oil and Gas Partnership #1: $4,000 profit
Medical Research Partnership #2: ($9,000 loss)
Wind Energy Partnership #3: ($16,000 loss)
A. $6,000 carryover loss.
B. $0 carryover loss. He can offset his wages. 
C. $21,000 carryover loss
D. $15,000 carryover loss
C:
Eduardo has a $21,000 carryover loss. Net loss = ($9,000)+ ($16,000) + $4,000 = ($21,000). The full $21,000 passive activity loss for the taxable year is disallowed, and cannot offset his wages (it is not a rental activity, and therefore not eligible for the special $25,000 'rental loss allowance'). All the losses must be carried forward to a following year to offset future passive income, or until the taxpayer disposes of the activity. Based on an example from Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules. 
7. Question ID: 94849526 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Stephen, a landlord, made several repairs and improvements to his rental house. He spent $13,500 to install permanent tile in all of the bedrooms, $1,200 to repaint the exterior of the home, $170 to replace the broken faucet in the bathroom, and $590 to replace several damaged shingles on the roof. How much of these costs must he depreciate?
A. $14,200
B. $14,960
C. $13,500
D. $14,790
C:
Only the cost of the flooring would have to be depreciated, and it would be depreciated over 27.5 years. The rest of the costs can be expensed as repairs, including the painting of the exterior. Most flooring is considered to be permanently affixed. These types of flooring include hardwood, tile, vinyl and glued-down carpet. Per Publication 527 Residential Rental Property, permanent flooring such as tile or hardwood is depreciated over a period of 27.5 years. However, flooring subject to more wear and tear, such as carpeting, can be depreciated over 5 years.
9. Question ID: 94849541 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Antwan is single. He has the following income and losses during the year:
Wages: $55,000
Passive activity income from a limited partnership: $4,000
Passive loss from a rental real estate activity (in which he actively participated): $6,000
Which of the following statements is correct?
A. The first $4,000 of Antwan’s $6,000 passive loss offsets his passive income. He can deduct the remaining $2,000 to reduce taxation of his wages.
B. He cannot deduct the passive loss to reduce taxation of his wages.
C. He must carry over his loss to the next tax year.
D. He cannot offset the rental loss against the passive income from the partnership because it is not the same type of passive activity.
A:
Antwan can use $4,000 of his rental loss to offset the passive activity income from the limited partnership. The remaining $2,000 loss can be deducted to reduce taxation of his wages.
Note: A taxpayer can deduct up to $25,000 per year of losses for rental real estate activities in which he actively participates. This special allowance is an exception to the general rule of disallowing losses from passive activities in excess of passive activity income. This $25,000 allowance is only allowed for rental activities. However, there are income limitations. If modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds $100,000 ($50,000 if MFS), the allowance is limited to 50% of the difference between $150,000 ($75,000 if MFS) and MAGI. If MAGI is $150,000 or more ($75,000 or more if MFS), the losses are disallowed and must be carried forward.
10. Question ID: 94855000 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Peter owns a lake cottage that he bought last year, intending to use the home as a vacation property for himself. In the current year, he rented the cottage for 10 days to a stranger, and Peter used the cottage for 20 days for his own personal use. The cottage was not used the rest of the year, and sat empty. Peter had rental income of $1,000 and he paid $450 for repairs because his renter broke a window. How should he report these activities on his tax return?
A. $1,000 income, $450 expense on Schedule C
B. $0 income, $0 expense (it does not have to be reported)
C. $1,000 reported as 'other income' and no rental expenses would be permitted.
D. $1,000 income, $450 expense on Schedule E
B:
Peter would report $0 income, and $0 expenses (i.e., this rental activity does not have to be reported). If you rent out a personal dwelling for less than 15 days during the tax year, this is considered 'Minimal Rental Use.' This is a special rule that applies, if the property qualifies as a residence and is rented for less than 15 days during the year, then the rental income is not taxable, and no expenses would be deductible.

11. Question ID: 94850305 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Joshua is unmarried and works full time as a college professor. He is not a real estate professional, but he does own a residential rental that he manages himself. Joshua earned $120,000 in salary at his job, and a ($31,000) loss from his rental real estate activities in which he actively participated. He reports the rental on Schedule E. He had no other income or loss for the year. Based on this information, figure out his passive loss carryover.
A. $16,000
B. $15,000
C. $31,000
D. $6,000
A:
When Joshua files his return, he can deduct only $15,000 of his passive activity loss. He must carry over the remaining $16,000 passive activity loss to the following year. He must figure his deduction and carryover as follows:
Adjusted gross income 	$120,000
Minus amount not subject to phaseout 	($100,000)
Amount subject to phaseout rule 	$20,000
Multiply by 50% 	X 50% 
Reduction to 'special allowance' 	$10,000
Maximum 'special allowance' 	$25,000
Minus reduction 	$10,000
Adjusted 'Special allowance' 	$15,000
Passive loss from rental activity 	$31,000
Deduction allowable in the current year 	($15,000)
Amount of losses that must be carried forward 	$16,000
Based directly on an example in Publication 925. 
12. Question ID: 94849631 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Ivan buys an apartment building for $160,000 on January 10. He plans to rent it out to long-term tenants. The latest real estate tax assessment on the property allocates 85% of the value to the building and 15% to the land. What is his basis for depreciation on Schedule E?
A. $24,000
B. $160,000
C. $136,000
D. $0.
C:
Ivan's basis for depreciation is $136,000 (85% × $160,000). When determining the basis for calculating depreciation, the cost basis of the land and building need to be calculated separately. The basis of the land is not subject to depreciation.
14. Question ID: 95033971 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
What type of rental property is never depreciated?
A. Undeveloped land.
B. Commercial buildings.
C. Residential rentals.
D. Land improvements.
A:
The cost of land is never depreciated, even if it is used in rental activity (for example, rented farmland, or undeveloped land that is used as an overflow parking lot). Land improvements, such as fencing, paved parking areas, and outdoor lighting, may be depreciated.
15. Question ID: 94850304 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Angelo, an unmarried taxpayer, owns a rental property that he actively manages himself. He collects the rents and chooses the tenants. He also works full-time as a math tutor. Angelo had the following income and loss during the tax year.
Salary from his tutoring job 	$42,300
Dividends 	300
Interest from a CD 	1,400
Rental loss 	(5,000)
The rental loss came from the house, which he owns. Although he actively participated in the rental activity, he is not a real estate professional. Based on this information, how much of the rental loss is Angelo permitted to deduct against his other taxable income in the current year?
A. Up to $3,000 in losses, the maximum capital loss limit for an individual taxpayer. 
B. He may not deduct any of the losses in the current year, because he has no passive activity income to offset. The full amount must be carried over to future years. 
C. He may deduct the full amount of his losses ($5,000) against his wages. 
D. Up to $1,700 in losses, to offset the amount of his dividends and interest ($300 + $1,400)
C:
He may deduct the full amount of his losses ($5,000) against his wages. The rental loss came from a house he owned. He advertised and rented the house to the current tenant himself. He also collected the rents and did the repairs or hired someone to do them. Even though the rental loss is a loss from a passive activity, he can use the entire loss to offset his other income because he 'actively participated' in the activity. This example is based directly on a scenario in Publication 925. 
Note: Special $25,000 allowance: If you or your spouse actively participated in a passive rental real estate activity, the amount of the passive activity loss that’s disallowed is decreased and you therefore can deduct up to $25,000 of loss from the activity from your nonpassive income. This special allowance is an exception to the general rule disallowing the passive activity loss. Similarly, you can offset credits from the activity against the tax on up to $25,000 of nonpassive income after taking into account any losses allowed under this exception. 
18. Question ID: 98939168 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Jenny and Blaze are married and file jointly. Jenny earns $80,000 as a registered nurse. Blaze earns $92,000 as a school administrator. They co-own and manage a residential rental together. They actively participate in the rental activity, but neither is a real estate professional. The rental activity is not profitable, and Jenny and Blaze incur a ($29,000) loss on Schedule E. Based on these facts, what is the maximum amount of rental losses that Jenny and Blaze can deduct from their nonpassive income (their wages)?
A. $12,500
B. $25,000
C. $0
D. $29,000
C:
They cannot deduct any of their rental losses. Under the passive activity rules, you can deduct up to $25,000 in passive losses against your ordinary income (W-2 wages) if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is $100,000 or less. This deduction phases out $1 for every $2 of MAGI above $100,000 until $150,000 when it is completely phased out. Blaze and Jenny's wages exceed the maximum threshold ($80,000 wages + $92,000 wages = $172,000). Their passive loss must be carried forward to future tax years to offset any passive income.
Note: If their income drops below the threshold in future years, (for example, if one of them stops working) or, if they decide to dispose of the activity (they sell the rental) then the carryover losses will be released at that time. Learn more about the special rules for rental losses in Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules. 
20. Question ID: 94849651 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Norbert purchased his home six years ago for $250,000. The purchase price was allocatable to fair market values of (1) $50,000 for the underlying land and (2) $200,000 for the house. Norbert paid an additional $18,000 for adding an additional bathroom to the home. Norbert moves out of the home on June 1, because of a job transfer. Instead of selling the home, he decides to rent it out. A tenant moved in on October 1, 2023. The FMV of the property on October 1 was $310,000, comprised of $65,000 for the land and $245,000 for the house. He paid $2,400 for plumbing repairs during November after his tenant discovered a water leak in the garage. Based upon the information listed, what is the basis on which depreciation should be calculated during the rental period?
A. $270,400
B. $245,000
C. $250,000
D. $218,000
D:
The basis for depreciation is the lesser of fair market value or the taxpayer’s adjusted basis on the date the property was converted to rental use. The adjusted basis on October 1 was $218,000 (original cost of $200,000 + improvements of $18,000). Since this amount was lower than the FMV of the home ($245,000) on the same date, the lower figure must be used as the basis for depreciation on the property. The basis of the land is not subject to depreciation (land is never depreciated). The plumbing repairs are deductible as a current expense and are not depreciated. Instead, the repairs would simply be deductible as an expense on Schedule E.
21. Question ID: 94815927 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Antonio is unmarried and owns a residential rental property. He is not a real estate professional. He reports his rental income on Schedule E. In the current year, his wage income was $82,000, and his losses from the rental property were $27,000. He actively participated in the rental activity. How much of the rental loss can he deduct on his individual tax return?
A. $27,000
B. $0, the losses are completely disallowed by the passive activity rules.
C. $25,000, with a $2,000 loss carryover.
D. $25,000 with no carryover.
C:
Antonio can deduct up to $25,000 of his rental losses from his active income. The disallowed amount ($2,000) can be carried over to the next year. If a taxpayer actively participates in a passive rental real estate activity that produces a loss, the taxpayer can deduct the loss from non-passive income, up to $25,000. This $25,000 allowance is only allowed for rental activities. However, there are income limitations. If modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds $100,000 ($50,000 if MFS), the allowance is limited to 50% of the difference between $150,000 ($75,000 if MFS) and MAGI. If MAGI is $150,000 or more ($75,000 or more if MFS), the losses are disallowed and must be carried forward. To learn more about rental losses and passive loss limits, refer to Publication 925, Passive Activities and At-Risk Rules.
22. Question ID: 94849596 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Tony lives near a popular football arena. He rents his main home during sporting events for 12 days during the tax year and earns $2,500. During the time he rents his home, he stays across town with his parents. Tony does not rent his home at any other time during the year. How should this income be reported?
A. The income is taxed as rental income and should be reported on Schedule E.
B. The income is not taxable and does not need to be reported.
C. The income is taxed as ordinary income and should be reported as “other income” on Form 1040. The income is not subject to self-employment tax.
D. The income is taxed as ordinary income and is subject to self-employment tax.
B:
The income is not taxable and does not need to be reported. There is an exception when a taxpayer rents his primary residence for fewer than 15 days during the year. That period is not treated as rental activity. This is also called the “15 day rule” or the exception for “Minimal Rental Use”. The taxpayer is not required to report the income and is not allowed to deduct the rental expenses.
23. Question ID: 94849726 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Rajeev lives in a community where there is a large music festival for two weeks during August every year. He usually rents out his home for these 14 days and goes to visit his sister. In the current year, he had $6,000 of rental income and $700 of expenses from the 14 rental days. How should Rajeev report this income and expense on his tax return?
A. $6,000 of rental income and $700 of expenses on Schedule E.
B. No reporting is required of either the rental income or rental expenses.
C. $6,000 of rental income added to his other income on Form 1040; $700 of expenses deducted on Schedule A.
D. $6,000 of rental income added to his other income on Form 1040; $28 (4% of 365 days) of expenses deducted on Schedule A.
B:
The primary function of a home that is rented for less than 15 days during the year is not considered to be rental, and it should not be reported on Schedule E. This is called the '15-day rule' or 'minimal rental use'. Rajeev is not required to report the rental income and expenses from this activity. Any regular expenses such as mortgage interest and property taxes are reported as normally allowed for a home on Schedule A, but no expenses related to the rental activity can be deducted.
24. Question ID: 94849675 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Deandre owns a residential rental tri-plex and actively participates in the rental activity. The cost basis of the building is $164,000. According to the property tax rolls, the value of the property is allocated as follows:
$124,000 allocated to the building.
$40,000 allocated to the land.
The building was placed into service four years ago. Deandre chose to depreciate the building using MACRS straight-line depreciation. Residential rental property is always depreciated over 27.5 years. Based on this information, how much depreciation expense can Deandre claim per year?
A. $4,509
B. $5,964
C. $0
D. $1,456
A:
The depreciable basis for the building is limited to the value of the building ($124,000). The basis of land is never depreciated. Since residential rental property is depreciated over 27.5 years, a basis of $124,000 would generate depreciation of $4,509 per year ($124,000/27.5 years). Rental activity is reported on Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss. The depreciation of rentals is reported on Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization.
25. Question ID: 94850303 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Thomas owns a rental property in Miami, Florida, that he rents out to short-term tenants. Thomas provides services like fresh linens, fresh towels daily, and a complimentary breakfast for his guests. What form should he report this income?
A. Schedule D
B. Schedule E
C. Schedule C
D. Schedule F
C:
Thomas should report the rental income on Schedule C. If a property owner provides “substantial services” to short-term renters, the IRS says that the rental activity should be reported on Schedule C. The IRS defines substantial services as services generally provided to guests that are primarily for their convenience and not normally provided with a rental. For example, meals, daily laundry, and maid services.
26. Question ID: 97473769 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Gary and Betty are married but have lived apart for 5 years. They both file MFS returns. Gary owns a residential rental that he manages himself. His wages for the year were $38,000, and he had no other taxable income. He incurred a ($5,000) loss on his rental property. How much of his rental loss is he allowed to deduct on his tax return?
A. $0, because he is filing MFS
B. $3,000
C. $5,000
D. $2,500
C:
Gary can deduct the entire rental loss against his wages. This is because, even though he files MFS, he is allowed to take the full rental loss because (1) he did not live with his spouse, (2) his MAGI was under $50,000, and (3) his rental losses were less than $12,500 (one-half of the “special allowance”).
27. Question ID: 98939161 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Thomas is unmarried and works full-time as a bank manager, earning $82,000 a year. He also owns a residential rental which he reports on Schedule E. He actively participates in the rental activity, but he is not a real estate professional. This year, he was forced to evict his tenants from his rental, which ended up costing him thousands of dollars in legal fees. Thomas ends up incurring a ($32,000) loss on Schedule E. Based on these facts, what is the maximum amount of rental losses that Thomas can deduct from his nonpassive income?
A. $0
B. $12,500
C. $25,000
D. $32,000
C:
The maximum amount of rental losses that he can deduct from nonpassive income would be $25,000. Under the passive activity rules you can deduct up to $25,000 in passive losses against your ordinary income (W-2 wages) if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is $100,000 or less. Since Thomas earned less than $100,000 in wages and had no other income sources for the year, he is permitted to deduct up to $25,000 of his rental losses in the current year. The remaining rental losses would be carried to the following year, where the same rules and limits would apply. Learn more about the special rules for rental losses in Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules. 
28. Question ID: 94849524 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Which of the following is not rental income in the year received?
A. Refundable security deposit 
B. One year of pre-paid rent, paid in advance by the tenant
C. Repairs paid by the tenant in lieu of rent
D. Payment to cancel the remaining lease
A:
A security deposit is not rental income if the deposit is meant to be returned to a tenant at the end of the lease agreement. 
30. Question ID: 94849700 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Ignatius owns one-half of a residential rental house. His cousin, Marina, owns the other half. The house is rented out all year to long-term tenants. Last year, Ignatius paid $968 out of pocket for repairing a broken water pipe on the property. How should this expense be treated on his tax return?
A. He can deduct $484 (50% × $968) as a rental expense on Schedule E. He is entitled to reimbursement for the remaining half from the co-owner.
B. He can deduct $484 (50% × $968) as a rental expense on Schedule E. The other 50% he can claim as an adjustment to income on his Form 1040.
C. He can deduct $968 as a rental expense on Schedule E.
D. He can deduct $968 as a business expense on Schedule C.
A:
If you own a part interest in rental property, you can deduct expenses you paid according to your percentage of ownership. Therefore, Ignatius can deduct $484 (50% X $968) as a rental expense. He is also entitled to reimbursement for the remaining half from the co-owner. See Publication 527, Residential Rental Property, for more information and to see similar examples. 
31. Question ID: 97473768 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Frank owns a residential rental property that he actively manages himself. He collects rental income of $20,600 during the year. The rental expenses total $16,000, plus $12,000 of depreciation. He earns $98,500 in wages during the year, and has no other activity for the year. He files as single. What is his allowable rental loss on Schedule E?
A. $7,400
B. $28,000
C. $0
D. $10,600
A:
Frank has a net loss on his rental of $7,400 ($20,600 rental income - $28,000 ($16,000 rental expenses + $12,000 depreciation). The loss is permitted because he actively participates in the activity, and his income is below the threshold for the special loss allowance. He also can deduct the $7,400 loss from his other income (i.e., his wages).
32. Question ID: 94849531 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Yahir and Taliyah are married and file jointly. Yahir earned $85,000 of wages and Taliyah had net income of $4,000 on her Schedule F, from selling eggs and chickens that she raised herself. They had interest income of $700. Taliyah also had a $32,000 loss from a rental real estate activity in which she actively participated. She is not a real estate professional. Based on this information, how much of the rental loss can they deduct on their joint tax return?
A. $0
B. $25,000
C. $32,000
D. $4,000
B:
Since Taliyah actively participated in the rental activity and their adjusted gross income is less than $100,000, they are allowed to deduct $25,000 of rental losses against other income. A special rule allows taxpayers deduct up to $25,000 of losses from rental real estate in which you actively participate. This is often called the '$25,000 rental loss allowance'. The $25,000 allowance is phased out when modified adjusted gross income is from $100,000 to $150,000, resulting in no deduction if the taxpayer's AGI is above $150,000. They can carry forward the remainder of the rental losses to the following tax year, subject to the same limitation.
34. Question ID: 94815999 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Marcas is a Canadian resident and citizen who owns a profitable rental property in the US that nets $50,000 in rental income per year. He is not currently a citizen or resident of the US, but he has a Social Security number because he worked in the US decades ago. How should Marcas report his rental income?
A. Marcas should file Form 1040-NR.
B. Since he has a valid SSN, Marcas can choose whether to file Form 1040-NR or Form 1040.
C. Marcas does not need to file any US tax return.
D. Marcas should file Form 1040.
A:
In order to report his income, Marcas will need to file Form 1040-NR. Just because someone has an SSN, doesn't mean they are a resident of the US for tax purposes. Many nonresident aliens have a Social Security number for various reasons. 
4. Question ID: 94849691 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Samuel owns a ten-unit apartment building and charges $800 rent per month for each unit. Nine units were rented for the entire year. A tenant occupied the tenth unit from January 1 to June 30. The tenant did considerable damage to the apartment so the tenant’s security deposit of $500 was not refunded to her when she moved out. Another tenant rented the apartment for $800 a month with a one-year lease, beginning September 1, 2023. The new tenant paid the first and last months’ rent and a refundable security deposit of $500. Disregarding any allowable expenses, how much gross rental income must Samuel report on Schedule E for the year?
A. $94,400
B. $96,200
C. $95,700
D. $95,200
C:
Samuel must include all the rental income, including the forfeited security deposit he retains for the damage to the unit. The refundable security deposit from the new tenant is not included in Samuel’s income because it is refundable. The answer is calculated as follows:
$800 rent × 12 months × 9 units: $86,400.
$800 rent × 6 months for tenant from Jan through June: $4,800.
Security deposit retained for tenant who moved out: $500.
$800 rent × 4 months for new tenant from September through December: $3,200.
Advance rent paid by new tenant: $800.
Total Rental Income $95,700
8. Question ID: 94849536 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Which of the following rental activities would be listed on Schedule C, rather than Schedule E?
A. Rental of an office building to business tenants. 
B. Rental of an empty lot for parking overflow. 
C. Rental of a rental home to long-term tenants. 
D. Rental of personal property, such as vehicles and equipment. 
D:
Taxpayers generally use Schedule E, to report income and expenses related to real estate rentals. 'Real estate' can mean a residential rental home, an office building, or an empty lot. The rental of personal property (such as vehicles, equipment, etc.) is reported differently, however.
Taxpayers should report income and expenses related to personal property rentals on Schedule C, (if they are in the business of renting personal property).
Taxpayers should report income and expenses on Schedule 1 (as 'other income'), if they are not in the business of renting personal property (this might include someone who rented their own vehicle, RV, or a boat for a short time).
Study Tip: 'Personal property' is an accounting term that is commonly defined as any property that is not attached to the land or to structures on real estate. The main characteristic of personal property is that it is movable, unlike real property or real estate. To see more information about personal property rentals, see IRS Topic No. 414 Rental Income and Expenses.
13. Question ID: 94849626 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
LuAnn rents a room in her home to a college student for nine months of the year. The student pays $600 a month in rent. The home has five rooms in the house. Each room is approximately the same size. LuAnn paid the following expenses in the current year:
Mortgage interest: $9,000
Homeowner’s insurance: $1,000
Property taxes: $2,000
Utilities: $1,000
What amounts should LuAnn report as rental income and deduct as rental expenses on her Schedule E?
A. Rental income: $3,450; deduction: $0.
B. Rental income: $5,400; deduction: $13,000.
C. Rental income: $5,400; deduction: $2,600.
D. Rental income: $5,400; deduction: $1,950.
D:
LuAnn must report the full amount of rental income collected: (9 × $600 =$5,400). Her expenses total $13,000. Because the student uses one-fifth (20%) of her house, she can deduct 20% of the expenses ($13,000 × .20 = $2,600), but only for the nine months during which the student rented the room. Thus, the expenses must be further allocated for the period of occupancy (9/12 months = 75% × $2,600 = $1,950).
A taxpayer who rents part of a property must divide certain expenses between the part of the property used for rental purposes and the part used for personal purposes, as though there were actually two separate pieces of property. Expenses related to the part of the property used for rental purposes can be deducted as rental expenses on Schedule E. This includes a portion of expenses that normally are nondeductible personal expenses, such as painting the outside of a house. If an expense applies to both rental use and personal use, such as a heating bill for the entire house, the taxpayer must allocate the expense between the two. The two most common methods for allocating such expenses are based on:
The number of rooms in the house, and
The square footage of the house.

Geraldine owns three rental properties, which all have long-term tenants. She also has a full-time job as a teacher. Which form would she use to report her rental income and losses?
A. Schedule A
B. Schedule D
C. Schedule C
D. Schedule E
D:
Rental income and expenses are reported on Schedule E, which is then attached to the taxpayer's Form 1040. Rental income is any payment received for the use or occupation of property, and is generally passive activity income.
17. Question ID: 94849637 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Athene has a cabin in Lake Tahoe that she uses as a vacation home to go skiing, and also a rental. She rented out her ski home for 80 days during the year and used it personally for 20 days. She paid $2,000 for repairs and $4,000 for utilities. She received rental income of $16,000. What was Athene’s net rental income, after applying her allowable expenses?
A. $16,000
B. $0
C. $10,000
D. $11,200
D:
Athene's property is subject to special tax treatment because it is not strictly a rental, it is also a personal home. When a taxpayer has a residence (whether a main home or a second home) that is used personally at certain times and rented out at other times, she must divide her expenses between rental use and personal use. Rental expenses generally will be no more than a taxpayer’s total expenses multiplied by the following fraction: the denominator is the total number of days the dwelling is used and the numerator is the total number of days actually rented at a fair rental price. In this case, the home was used a total of 100 days and was rented for 80 days (80%). Only 80% ($6,000 × .80 = $4,800) of the expenses are deductible, so Athene’s net rental income after applying her allowable expenses is $11,200.
19. Question ID: 94849701 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Kaitlin owns a residential rental property. The sewage and water bill is in Kaitlin's name because she is the owner of the property. Her tenant pays the sewage bill for her rental property and deducts the amount from the normal rent payment. Under the terms of the lease, her tenant doesn’t have to pay this bill. How should Kaitlin treat this transaction on her Schedule E?
A. No reporting is required, since the amounts paid by the tenant are a 'wash'.
B. The property owner can deduct the utility payment made by the tenant as a rental expense on Schedule E.
C. The property owner must report the utility payment made by the tenant as rental income on Schedule E. No amounts are deductible in this scenario.
D. She must include the utility bill paid by the tenant as a rental payment in her rental income. She can deduct the utility payment made by the tenant as a rental expense.
D:
If your tenant pays any of your expenses, those payments are rental income. Because you must include this amount in income, you can also deduct the expenses if they are deductible rental expenses. If a tenant pays the water and sewage bill for a rental property, the taxpayer (i.e., the property owner) must include the utility bill paid by the tenant and any amount received as a rent payment in their rental income. The property owner can deduct the utility payment made by the tenant as a rental expense on Schedule E. See Publication 527, Residential Rental Property, for more information and to see similar examples. 
29. Question ID: 94815968 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Cecile is a limited partner in two different partnerships. Cecile also owns a residential rental that she manages herself, but she is not a real estate professional. All the activities generated a profit for the year. Where should Cecile report the income she receives from these activities?
A. The pass-through income from the partnership would be reported on Schedule D. The rental would be reported on Schedule E.
B. The pass-through income from the partnership would be reported on Schedule C. The rental would be reported on Schedule E.
C. All the income should be reported on Schedule C.
D. All the income should be reported on Schedule E.
D:
All the income should be reported on Schedule E (Form 1040). Taxpayers use Schedule E to report income (or loss) from rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, estates, trusts, and residual interests in REMICs.
33. Question ID: 94849599 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Which of the following is NOT rental income in the year received?
A. Payment to cancel the remaining lease.
B. Pre-paid rent (rent paid in advance)
C. Repairs paid by the tenant in lieu of rent.
D. Security deposit, equal to one month’s rent, to be refunded at the end of the lease if the building passes inspection.
D:
A refundable security deposit received from a tenant is not rental income. A security deposit is money that is given to a lender, seller, or landlord as proof of intent and may be used to pay for damages caused by a renter. A landlord should not include a security deposit in their income on Schedule E, if they may be required to return it to the tenant at the end of the lease.

All of the following types of settlements from lawsuits are taxable income except:
A. Unlawful discrimination award.
B. Settlements for loss in value of property that are less than the adjusted basis of the property.
C. Punitive damages.
D. Interest on a lawsuit settlement.
B:
Settlements for loss in value of property that are less than the adjusted basis of a taxpayer’s property are not taxable and generally do not need to be reported. A taxpayer must reduce his basis in the property by the amount of the settlement. If the property settlement exceeds the adjusted basis in the property, the excess is taxable income. The taxability of other types of settlements varies. For instance, in employment-related lawsuits such as unlawful discrimination or involuntary termination, the portion of the proceeds that is for lost wages is taxable. Punitive damages and interest on settlements also are generally taxable. Settlements for physical injuries or illness are generally not taxable, although the proceeds for emotional distress often are (unless the emotional distress originates from physical injury or illness).

4. Question ID: 94815930 (Topic: Other Taxable Income)
Garland has a partial interest in several partnerships. He is merely a passive investor and does not materially participate in any of the businesses. The income is reported to Garland on (multiple) Schedules K-1. During the year, Garland had the following results from these passive activities:
French-style Cafe: $56,000 loss.
Ice cream store: $32,000 loss.
Nutrition supplement store: $18,000 loss.
Doughnut shop: $90,000 income.
What is the tax treatment of Garland's ownership of these businesses, and how would the amounts be reported on his Form 1040?
A. Taxable income of $90,000 and deductible losses of $106,000. The amounts would be reported on Schedule C. 
B. Deductible capital loss of $16,000 in the tax year. The amounts would be reported on Schedule D. 
C. No taxable income; carryover of passive activity losses of $16,000 to the following year. The amounts would be reported on Schedule E. 
D. Taxable income of $90,000; carryover of passive activity losses of $106,000 to the following year. The amounts would be reported on Schedule E. 
C:
Under the passive activity limitation rules, Garland cannot deduct the full amount of his losses against taxable income from other sources. Since he had passive activity income of $90,000 during the year, he can offset losses up to that amount. He can carry over the remaining passive activity losses of $16,000 to the following year. Schedule E is used to record income and loss for partners in a partnership, whether the activity is passive or not.

1. Question ID: 94815908 (Topic: Taxable Recoveries)
Boldo received a state tax refund related to his prior-year return. He itemized deductions on Schedule A in the previous year and plans to itemize again in the current year. How does Boldo's state tax refund affect his current year tax return?
A. Boldo must report his state tax refund as a reduction of his itemized deduction for state income taxes paid on his current year tax return.

3. Question ID: 94815858 (Topic: Taxable Alimony)
Belinda is married to Jesse. They are both US citizens and live in Montana, a non-community property state. They have no children. Because of financial problems caused by her first husband, Belinda refuses to file a joint return with anyone, including Jesse. Belinda files her own tax return separately. Belinda receives her W-2 from her employer. She earned $83,000 from her job. She also receives Form 1099-INT from her credit union, reporting $357 in interest earned on her savings account. She also paid $5,000 in alimony to her ex-husband, who she divorced in 2015. She has no other income or adjustments. Based on this information, what is her AGI?
    A. $78,000
    B. $83,000
    C. $83,357
    D. $78,357
D:
Her AGI (adjusted gross income) is $78,357, figured as follows:
$83,000 Wages +
$357 Interest income
$83,357 (this is Belinda's 'gross income')
-$5,000 Alimony paid (this is an adjustment to income)
=$78,357 AGI
Note: Belinda's gross income includes her wages, interest, capital gains, income from retirement accounts. This total is then adjusted downward by specific deductions (including alimony paid) to arrive at AGI, or 'adjusted gross income.' Under the TCJA, an individual whose divorce was finalized in 2019 and pays alimony to an ex-spouse will no longer be able to deduct those payments. However, any divorce decree that was finalized before 2019 is considered “grandfathered” which means that those alimony payments remain deductible to the payor. Since Belinda's divorce was finalized in 2015, her decree is considered 'grandfathered' and her alimony payments are still deductible.

1. Question ID: 94849607 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Kendra bought a new car for $30,000. She made a $5,000 down payment and borrowed the remaining $25,000 from her bank via a recourse loan. After she stopped making payments, the bank repossessed the car. The balance due on the loan at the time of the repossession was $15,000. The FMV of the car when repossessed was $12,000. She later receives a 1099-C for the canceled debt. She was not insolvent when the debt was canceled, because she has $40,000 in a traditional IRA account. What amount is Kendra’s loss and what amount must she report as cancellation of debt income?
    A. $15,000 nondeductible loss; $12,000 COD.
    B. $13,000 deductible loss; $0 COD.
    C. $18,000 nondeductible loss; $3,000 COD.
    D. $13,000 nondeductible loss; $3,000 COD.
C:
A taxpayer is personally liable for a recourse loan. Since a repossession is treated as a sale, the gain or loss must be computed. Kendra compares the amount realized ($12,000) with her adjusted basis ($30,000) in the vehicle to determine that she has an $18,000 nondeductible loss. She also has ordinary income from cancellation of debt. That income is $3,000 ($15,000 canceled debt − $12,000 FMV). Kendra must report the canceled debt as income on her Form 1040.

    A. Nonrecourse loans
    B. Mortgage loans
    C. Recourse loans
    D. Credit card debt

5. Question ID: 94850120 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Isaac has canceled debt from a foreclosure on his vacation home. The mortgage on the property was a recourse debt. What does this mean?
    A. A recourse debt means that the debt is unsecured.
    B. It means that the lender cannot pursue anything other than the collateral.
    C. A recourse debt means that Isaac is personally liable for the loan.
    D. A recourse debt means that Issac must file a civil action.
C:
A recourse debt holds the borrower personally liable. This means that Isaac is personally liable for the mortgage. All other debt is considered nonrecourse. A nonrecourse debt (loan) does not allow the lender to pursue anything other than the collateral. For example, if a borrower defaults on a nonrecourse home loan, the bank can only foreclose on the home. The bank generally cannot take further legal action to collect the money owed on the debt. Whether a debt is recourse or nonrecourse may depend on state law.
6. Question ID: 94849728 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Joel’s primary residence is subject to a $320,000 mortgage debt. His basis in the home is $340,000. Joel loses his job and is unable to make his mortgage payments, so his bank forecloses on the home on January 10, 2023. Due to declining real estate values in his city, Joel's former residence is sold for $280,000 on December 15, 2023, as a short-sale. The debt was canceled by the mortgage lender and Joel receives a Form 1099-C reporting the cancellation. Joel was not insolvent at the time. What amount of taxable income from cancellation of debt must Joel report on his tax return?
    A. $0
    B. $60,000
    C. $40,000
    D. $30,000
A:
Joel has $40,000 of cancelled debt from the discharge of indebtedness. However, none of the canceled debt is taxable to Joel because it is excluded from income because it is primary residence indebtedness. Qualified principal residence indebtedness can be excluded from income. Generally, if a taxpayer excludes canceled debt from income, the taxpayer must attach Form 982, Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness, to report the amount of debt qualifying for exclusion. To learn more about cancellation of debt, see IRS Topic No. 431, Canceled Debt.

    A. Form 1099-C.
    B. Form 1099-MISC.
    C. Form 8606.
    D. Form W-2G.
A:

The canceled amount must be included in gross income, unless it qualifies for a specific exclusion (such as debt canceled during insolvency or a Title 11 bankruptcy case), or an exception to inclusion (such as cancellation of certain qualified student loans). None of the other answers are correct. The Form 1099-MISC reports miscellaneous income to a taxpayer. The Form W-2G reports gambling winnings. Form 8606 reports nondeductible contributions to an IRA.
8. Question ID: 94849548 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Rhonda had to give up her main home to foreclosure. She has a Form 1099-C, which shows the cancellation of her mortgage loan. Despite facing financial difficulties, she did not declare bankruptcy. She is also not insolvent because she has a retirement plan at work, but she does not want to withdraw from her retirement account. Rhonda confirmed that the entirety of the mortgage loan was used to buy the house. According to her Form 1099-C, $60,000 worth of debt was forgiven. How should this cancelled debt be reported on Rhonda's tax return?
    A. The cancellation of debt is fully taxable and must be reported as 'other income' because she is not insolvent or in bankruptcy.
    B. No income or loss to report.
    C. The cancelled debt is not taxable. She must report the amount qualifying for exclusion on Form 982 and attach the form to her tax return.

10. Question ID: 94849617 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
When Danny and June married five years ago, June's parents loaned them $30,000 for a down payment on their first house. Danny and June made regular payments on the loan until June's parents were killed in an accident in 2023. When they died, Danny and June still owed $17,500 on the balance of the loan. One of the terms of June's parents’ will was that any balance remaining on the loan would be forgiven at their death and would be considered a gift. How should this be reported on Danny and June's joint tax return?
    A. Danny and June do not have to recognize income due to the forgiveness of the debt. No reporting is required.
    B. Danny and June do not have to recognize income due to the forgiveness of the debt, but they are required to file a gift tax return.
    C. Danny and June have to recognize income due to the forgiveness of the debt, but only the amount above the gift limit.
    D. Danny and June have to recognize $17,500 in income due to the forgiveness of the debt.
A:
Danny and June do not have to recognize income due to the forgiveness of the debt. No reporting is required. Loans forgiven as gifts are not taxed. If a debt is canceled by a private lender, such as a relative or friend, and the cancellation is intended as a gift, there is no income that has to be reported. Danny and June are not required to file gift tax returns, because any gift tax reporting is always done by the donor (not the donee, or the recipient of the gift).
12. Question ID: 94849513 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Janine had $5,000 of credit card debt, which she did not pay. She received a Form 1099-C from her credit card company showing canceled debt of $5,000 at the end of the year. Immediately before the cancellation, her total liabilities from all sources were $15,000 and the FMV of her total assets was $7,000. How much of the canceled debt is taxable to Janine?
    A. $2,000
    B. $0
    C. $5,000
    D. $7,000
B:
At the time the debt was canceled, Janine was insolvent to the extent of $8,000 ($15,000 total debt minus $7,000 FMV of her total assets). She can exclude the entire $5,000 canceled debt from income. She must file Form 982 to report the canceled debt, and she should mark the box for insolvency.
13. Question ID: 94815960 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Canceled debt is generally taxable, but there are several exclusions from the general rule for reporting canceled debt as income. Which of the following types of canceled debt would NOT qualify for exclusion in 2023?
    A. Discharge of debt through bankruptcy.
    B. Discharge of qualified principal residence indebtedness.
    C. Recourse debt on a car that was repossessed by a lender.
    D. Discharge of debt of insolvent taxpayer.
C:
The recourse debt on a vehicle would likely be taxable canceled debt. If a lender forecloses on property subject to a recourse debt and cancels the portion of the debt in excess of the fair market value (FMV) of the property, the canceled portion of the debt is treated as ordinary income from cancellation of indebtedness. This amount must be included in gross income unless it qualifies for an exception or exclusion. The exclusions are:
    Discharge of debt through bankruptcy.
    Discharge of debt of insolvent taxpayer.
    Discharge of qualified farm indebtedness.
    Discharge of qualified real property business indebtedness.
    Discharge of qualified principal residence indebtedness.

How much should Ambrose report on his Form 1040 as taxable income?
    A. Ambrose must include $2,000 as 'other income' on his tax return.
    B. Ambrose must include $7,000 as 'other income' on his tax return.
    C. Ambrose does not have to include the cancelled debt on his tax return.
    D. Ambrose must include $5,000 as 'other income' on his tax return.
D:
Ambrose has $5,000 in cancellation of debt income ($7,000 - $2,000). Since Ambrose was not insolvent at the time of the cancellation, he must include the entire $5,000 as 'other income' on his tax return (example from Publication 4491).
15. Question ID: 95003697 (Topic: Cancellation of Debt Income)
Shane fell on hard times and stopped paying his mortgage in the prior year. His home was later foreclosed. At the time of foreclosure, he owed a balance of $190,000 to the lender and the FMV of the property was $150,000 at the time of the foreclosure. For tax purposes, the foreclosure is treated as a sale. Shane's mortgage loan was nonrecourse. Based on this information, what would the 'sale price' be for reporting this transaction?
    A. The sale price would be $0.
    B. The sale price would be $150,000.
    C. The sale price would be $40,000.
    D. The sale price would be $190,000.
D:
Since Shane is not personally liable for the debt (a nonrecourse loan), the 'selling price' would be $190,000. Nonrecourse debt is satisfied by the surrender of the secured property regardless of the FMV at the time of surrender, and the borrower is not personally liable for the debt. If property that is subject to nonrecourse debt is abandoned, foreclosed upon, subject of a short sale, or repossessed by the lender, the circumstances are treated as a sale of the property by the taxpayer. In determining the gain or loss on the disposition of the property, the balance of the non-recourse debt at the time of the disposition of the property is included in the amount realized (generally the selling price). Since Shane is not personally liable for the debt, the difference between the FMV of the property and the balance of the loan is not included in his gross income (see detailed example in Publication 4491).

As part of the court's ruling, Aiyana was granted $95,000 in total damages, which included $20,000 to cover the costs of her medical care. She also received an additional $4,000 in interest on the award. How much of this court award would be taxable to Aiyana?
    A. $95,000 would be taxable
    B. $75,000 would be taxable
    C. $75,000 would be taxable as a court award, and $4,000 would be taxable as interest income 
    D. Only the $4,000 in interest would be taxable
Incorrect Answer Explanation for D:
$75,000 would be taxable as a court award ($95,000 damages - $20,000 reimbursement for her medical care), and $4,000 would be taxable separately, as interest income.
Note: Damages for harassment and emotional distress would generally be taxable, if the damanges were not directly related to a 'physical injury or physical illness.' However, any damages received for medical care directly related to the harassment or emotional distress are not taxable. Interest payments on any settlement award are also taxable.

7. Question ID: 94849659 (Topic: Taxation of Court Awards and Damages)
Heidi, age 22, suffered major physical injuries after a serious car accident. The auto manufacturer was found negligent for having faulty equipment installed on her car. A jury awarded Heidi the following damages from the lawsuit:
    $750,000 for physical injuries
    $200,000 for emotional distress as a direct result of the injuries
    $1 million for punitive damages against the auto manufacturer for faulty equipment
What amount of the damages is taxable to Heidi?
    A. $1 million
    B. $1,200,000
    C. $1,950,000
    D. $200,000
A:
Only the punitive damages are taxable. Settlements for personal physical injuries or physical illness are not taxable. Damages received for emotional distress due to physical injury or sickness are treated the same way as damages for physical injury or sickness, so they are not included in income. If emotional distress is not due to a physical injury (for example, an employment lawsuit in which a taxpayer suffers emotional distress for injury to reputation), the proceeds are taxable, except for any damages received for medical care due to that emotional distress. Emotional distress includes physical symptoms such as headaches, insomnia, and stomach disorders.

10. Question ID: 94850056 (Topic: Tax-Free Education Assistance (including Coverdell))
When Lonnie was born, three separate Coverdell Education Savings Accounts were set up for him: one by his parents, one by his grandmother, and one by his uncle. In 2023, what is the maximum amount of contributions that can be made to Lonnie’s Coverdell ESA accounts?
    A. $1,000 per each account.
    B. $2,000 total in all three accounts combined.
    C. $2,000 per each account.
    D. $6,000 total in all three accounts combined.
B:
In 2023, the total amount of contributions to all Coverdell ESA’s for one designated beneficiary cannot be more than $2,000. So, for instance, if Lonnie’s parents contribute $1,000 to his account and his grandmother contributes $800, his uncle could contribute no more than $200, for a combined total of $2,000. If more than $2,000 is contributed to the accounts, it is considered an excess contribution. If an excess contribution is made, then the penalty is imposed on the beneficiary (the child). The beneficiary must pay a 6% excise tax each year on excess contributions that are in a Coverdell ESA at the end of the year if the amount is not corrected or withdrawn.

D:
Generally, the interest earned on US savings bonds is taxable. If a taxpayer does not include the interest in income in the years it is earned, he must include it in his income in the year in which he cashes in the bonds. However, when a taxpayer cashes in qualified Series EE savings bonds, he does not have to include in his income some or all of the interest earned on the bonds if he meets the following conditions:
    He pays qualified education expenses for himself, his spouse, or a dependent for which he can claim an exemption on his tax return.
    His MAGI is less than the amount specified for his filing status.
    His filing status is not married filing separately.
A qualified US savings bond is a series EE bond issued after 1989 or a series I bond. The bond must be issued in the taxpayer’s name (as the sole owner) or in the names of he and his spouse (as co-owners). The owner must be at least 24 years old before the bond’s issue date.

5. Question ID: 95003636 (Topic: Tax-Free Education Assistance (including Coverdell))
Kimberly is an 18 year old student who is claimed as a dependent by her parents. She is the designated beneficiary of a 529 plan set up for her by her grandparents. She withdraws $10,000 from the 529 plan during the year. Which of the following would not be an allowable expense with the distribution, causing it to become a taxable event?
    A. Kimberly uses the $10,000 for tuition and books at a Florida State University.
    B. Kimberly uses the $10,000 for tuition and fees at a private Christian University.
    C. Kimberly uses the $10,000 for an apprenticeship program to be a dental technician.
    D. Kimberly uses the $10,000 for travel and expenses of being a missionary in a qualified religious organization.
D:
The $10,000 for travel and expenses of being a missionary in a qualified religious organization would not be a qualifying expense. A 529 plan is also called a Qualified Tuition Program. It is an investment account that offers tax benefits when used to pay for qualified education expenses for a designated beneficiary. Withdrawals from education savings plan accounts can generally be used at any college or university. Education savings plans can also be used to pay up to $10,000 per year per beneficiary for tuition at any public, private or religious elementary or secondary school (K-12). In 2019, student loan payments and costs of apprenticeship programs were added as qualified education expenses.
However, if 529 account withdrawals are not used for qualified education expenses, they will be subject to state and federal income taxes and an additional 10% federal tax penalty on earnings. Learn more about 529 plans, see IRS Topic No. 313 Qualified Tuition Programs (QTPs).
6. Question ID: 94850074 (Topic: Tax-Free Education Assistance (including Coverdell))

    D. Anytime.
D:
A designated beneficiary of a Coverdell ESA or a 529 Plan (also called a 'QTP' or a 'Qualified Tuition Program') can take a distribution at any time. However, in order for the distribution to be tax-free, distributions from the plan must not exceed qualified educational expenses.

11. Question ID: 94849666 (Topic: Tax-Free Education Assistance (including Coverdell))
Vinita is a 28-year old graduate student at a university pursuing a doctoral degree in biochemistry. During the current year, she received the following:
    $8,000 research fellowship.
    $5,500 scholarship that requires her to teach two undergraduate courses a year, of which $3,000 is designated as income for teaching.
Her qualified educational expenses for tuition, required books, and required laboratory fees were $12,000. What amount is excluded from Vinita’s taxable income?
    A. $0
    B. $16,500
    C. $8,000
    D. $10,500
D:
Vinita can exclude the full $8,000 of the fellowship and $2,500 of the scholarship. The $3,000 portion of the scholarship that is designated for her teaching is taxable income, because it is compensation for teaching two classes. A scholarship or fellowship is tax-free only if it meets all of the following requirements:
    The taxpayer must be a degree candidate at an eligible educational institution that has been nationally accredited.
    It does not exceed qualified educational expenses.
    It is not designated for other purposes, such as room and board.
    It does not represent payment for teaching, research, or other services.
2. Question ID: 94849672 (Topic: Gambling Winnings)
Usman regularly bets on horse racing. During the current year, he receives Forms W-2G for gambling winnings that total $85,000. His losses from horse racing are $93,000. He also occasionally gambles at a casino and wins $600 playing cards, but loses another $800. He does not receive Forms W-2G from the casino winnings. What amounts of gambling income and loss must Usman report on his Form 1040?
    A. $85,600 income; $85,600 loss.
    B. $85,000 income; $93,000 loss.
    C. $85,600 income; $93,800 loss.
    D. $8,200 net losses from gambling, no income needs to be reported.
A:
Usman must report all his gambling winnings on his federal income tax return, even for the amounts for which he did not receive Forms W-2G. He can deduct his gambling losses on Schedule A, but the deduction is limited to the amount of his winnings. In other words, the MOST that he would be able to deduct in losses is the amount of his winnings (you can't deduct more gambling losses than you win in a single year). He must report his winnings as income and claim his allowable losses separately; he cannot reduce his winnings by his losses and report the difference.

Lisa had the following income and losses during the year:
    Wages $14,000
    Interest income $425
    Gambling winnings $1,000
    Gambling losses (3,000)
    Discrimination lawsuit settlement $10,000
    Legal fees related to the lawsuit ($4,000)
    Child support payments $9,000
    Food stamp benefits $5,000
How much gross income must she report on her tax return?
    A. $14,000
    B. $25,425
    C. $35,425
    D. $21,425
B:
Lisa must report her wages, interest income, gambling income, and settlement from a discrimination lawsuit in her gross income ($14,000 + $425 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $25,425). The child support payments and the food stamp benefits are not taxable. The legal fees would be deductible as an adjustment to income, but she still must report the entire gross amount of the settlement. The gambling losses do not affect the inclusion of the gambling income within gross income. However, if Lisa chooses to itemize deductions, her gambling losses may be deducted on Schedule A to the extent of her gambling income. If Ginny does not itemize, the gambling losses are not deductible.
5. Question ID: 95015379 (Topic: Gambling Winnings)

Ishmael is considered a nonresident alien for US tax purposes. The casino automatically withholds a large sum from his winnings. Ishmael is a citizen of Canada, which has a beneficial tax treaty with the US. What does Ishmael have to do if he believes that he is owed a refund for the withheld amounts?
    A. Ishmael's gambling winnings are illegal and must be forfeited to US customs.

The IRS requires nonresidents of the US to report gambling winnings on Form 1040-NR. Gambling winnings, are considered to be 'not effectively connected' and must generally be reported on Form 1040-NR. Such income is generally taxed at a flat rate of 30%, (although a tax treaty with the taxpayer's home nation may allow for a lower tax rate).

    A. $34,500
    B. $119,500
    C. $0
    D. $28,000

2. Question ID: 94849632 (Topic: Taxable Government Benefits)
Which of the following statements regarding unemployment compensation is true?
    A. Unemployment compensation is taxable unless the taxpayer is disabled.
    B. Unemployment compensation must be included in a taxpayer's gross income.
    C. Unemployment compensation is taxable to the state, but not to federal.

It includes state unemployment insurance benefits and benefits paid to you by a state or the District of Columbia from the Federal Unemployment Trust Fund. It also includes railroad unemployment compensation benefits, but NOT worker's compensation. Worker's compensation (often called 'worker's comp') is not taxable to the recipient.
3. Question ID: 94849650 (Topic: Taxable Government Benefits)
Vitally fell ill after a chemical accident that occurred at his work. After the accident, he left his job and received several types of benefit payments during the year. Which of the following would be taxable to Vitally?

    C. $500 monthly payments received under an accident insurance policy (Vitally paid the premiums on the policy).
    D. A $32,000 legal settlement for physical sickness from his former employer.
A:
Vitally must report the $12,700 in unemployment compensation, because unemployment compensation is always taxable. Worker's compensation is not taxable. Legal settlements for personal physical injuries or physical sickness are non-taxable. If a taxpayer pays the premiums on an accident or health insurance policy, the benefits later received under the policy aren’t taxable. See IRS Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information.

    A. Sick pay.
    B. Vacation pay.

8. Question ID: 94849602 (Topic: Taxable Government Benefits)
Trina cares for her disabled son in her home. She receives Qualified Medicaid waiver payments from the government totaling $17,000 during the year. She received a Form 1099-NEC reporting these payments as non-employee compensation. She does not care for anyone else, other than her son, and does not have any other employment. How should these amounts be reported on Trina's tax return?
    A. She should report the amounts as 'other income' on Form 1040. 
    B. The amounts are not taxable. In order to offset the income that was reported to her on 1099-NEC, Trina should report the amount of those payments as income on Schedule C and also report the excludable amount as a Schedule C expense.
    C. She should report the amounts on Schedule C and deduct any related business expenses. 
    D. She should report the amounts as royalty payments on Schedule E. 
B:
The amounts are not taxable. Qualified Medicaid waiver payments are treated as 'difficulty of care' payments and are excludable from gross income. These are payments generally issued by the state.
If the taxpayer received Qualified Medicaid waiver payments as described in IRS Notice 2014-7, they may receive a Form 1099-MISC, 1099-NEC, or even a Form W-2 reporting the payments as non-employee compensation. 
IRS Notice 2014-7 addresses the income tax treatment of certain payments to an individual care provider under a state Home and Community-Based Services Waiver (Medicaid waiver) program. The notice provides that 'qualified Medicaid waiver payments' as difficulty-of-care payments are excludable from gross income. If the taxpayer chooses to exclude the payments received from gross income, the IRS suggests reporting the amount of those payments as income on Schedule C and also report the excludable amount as a Schedule C expense (this question is based on an example in the IRS' VITA courseware). Most software programs now have an override to ease reporting for this type of income. 
6. Question ID: 94849711 (Topic: Taxable Government Benefits)

D:
Supplemental wages are compensation paid to an employee in addition to regular wages and include, but are not limited to, bonuses, commissions, overtime pay, accumulated sick leave, severance pay, retroactive wage increases, and payments for non-deductible moving expenses. Worker's compensation is not taxable to the recipient at the state or federal level.

    D. The food stamps and utility bill assistance are non-taxable. The unemployment compensation is taxable.
D:
Both the food stamps and utility bill assistance are considered non-taxable. Unemployment compensation is taxable for IRS purposes.
1. Question ID: 94850381 (Topic: Hobby Income)
A key feature of a business is that people do it to make a profit. People engage in a hobby for sport or recreation, not to make a profit. The IRS presumes that an activity is carried on for profit if it:
    A. Makes a profit during at least 3 of the last 7 tax years, including the previous year.
    B. Makes a profit during at least 3 of the last 5 tax years, including the current year.
    C. Makes a profit during at least 3 of the last 10 tax years, including the current year.
    D. Makes a profit during at least 2 of the last 5 tax years, including the previous year.
B:
The IRS presumes that an activity is “carried on for profit” if it makes a profit during at least 3 of the last 5 tax years, including the current year. The general rule is 2 of the last 7 years for activities that consist primarily of breeding, showing, training or racing horses. The hobby loss rules apply to individuals, S corporations, trusts, estates, and partnerships but not to C corporations. 
2. Question ID: 94850408 (Topic: Hobby Income)
The hobby loss rules do not apply to which of the following entity types?
    A. Trusts.
    B. C Corporations.
    C. S Corporations.
    D. Individuals.
B:
The hobby loss rules apply to individuals, partners in a partnership, estates, trusts, and shareholders of S corporations. The hobby loss rules do not apply to C corporations. In other words, the 'hobby loss' rules of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) §183 attempt to curb perceived loss deduction abuses by activities that are not entered into for profit.

6. Question ID: 94849502 (Topic: Hobby Income)
The IRS presumes that an activity is 'carried on for profit' if it makes a profit for:
    A. Two years in a row.
    B. Three of the last five tax years, including the current year.
    C. Three years in a row.
    D. Two of the last three tax years, including the current year.
B:
The IRS presumes that an activity is carried on for profit if it makes a profit during at least three of the last five tax years, including the current year. In the case of breeding, showing, training, or racing horses, at least two of the last seven years must show a profit. If an activity is later determined to not be for profit, the losses from that activity may be disallowed. This happens when the IRS reclassifies a business as a hobby.
See the IRS detail page on how to distinguish between a business and a hobby.
7. Question ID: 94850351 (Topic: Hobby Income)
Which of the following activities would be classified as a hobby activity (rather than a business)?
    A. A rental activity that is profitable but one in which the taxpayer does not materially participate. 
    B. An activity that is carried on primarily for pleasure and recreation and occasionally turns a profit. 
    C. A new business activity that incurs a net operating loss in the current year. 
    D. A business activity that is carried on to make a profit but incurs losses for multiple years. 
B:
An activity must have a profit motive in order to be considered a business. A key feature of a business is that people do it to make a profit. People engage in a hobby for sport or recreation, not to make a profit. See the IRS detail page on hobby activities for more information. 
3. Question ID: 94849577 (Topic: Hobby Income)
Morty works full-time as a lifeguard. He is also a competitive surfer and has regularly participated in surfing competitions for the past six years with the intent to earn prize winnings. He has devoted significant time and effort to developing expertise in surfing, and he keeps good records that track his income and expenses associated with the surfing competitions. Morty has not yet earned a profit through the surfing competitions. As his tax preparer, what would you advise Morty?
    A. The surfing competitions constitute a business activity, so he can report his income and deduct his expenses on Schedule C.
    B. Morty does not have to claim any of the surfing competition income, but he is allowed to capitalize the expenses to a future year, for when he starts to make a profit. 
    C. Morty can choose to forego claiming the income and the expenses, since the activity is just a hobby.
    D. Morty is likely engaging in a hobby. His hobby-related expenses are not deductible, but his hobby income is taxable. 
D:
The IRS is likely to determine that Morty is engaging in a hobby and the surfing competitions are not a true business activity engaged in for profit. Although he maintains adequate records and enters surf competitions with the intent to earn money, he continues to enter competitions despite sustaining losses over several years, suggesting the lack of a true profit motive. A hobby is an activity typically undertaken primarily for pleasure. The IRS presumes that an activity is “carried on for a profit” if it makes a profit during at least three of the last five tax years, including the current year. Income from a hobby is taxable and reported on Form 1040 as “other income”. Expenses related to a hobby activity are no longer deductible due to changes implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

5. Question ID: 758501776 (Topic: Hobby Income)
Aishwarya has a hobby making baskets out of yarn and other crafting materials. She sells the baskets for $35 each at craft fairs sometimes, but mostly she just gives them out to family and friends as gifts. This year, she earned $1,200 from selling her baskets, and she spent $250 on materials to make the baskets. How much net income should she report from her hobby activity, and how should the income be reported?
    A. She should report $950 on Schedule C of her individual tax return.
    B. She should report the full amount of $1,200 on Schedule C. None of her expenses are deductible, because it is a hobby.
    C. She should report the full amount of $1,200 as 'other income' on Schedule 1 of her individual tax return.
    D. She should report $950 as 'other income' on Schedule 1 of her individual tax return. 
D:
Aishwarya should report $950 ($1,200 - $250) as 'other income' on Schedule 1 of her individual tax return. Income earned from a hobby must be reported on Form 1040, Schedule 1. This form is used to report additional income, such as hobby income, that is not reported on other forms.
Note: Expenses related to a hobby are not deductible, however, a taxpayer can deduct Cost of Goods Sold from gross receipts to calculate hobby income. Since Aishwarya spent $250 on supplies to actually build her baskets, these would be classified as COGS, and therefore deductible from her gross receipts to arrive at her taxable hobby income.

    B. Whether the taxpayer depends on income from the activity for their livelihood
    C. Whether the taxpayer enjoys the activity
    D. Whether the taxpayer has a bona fide intent to make a profit

Below is a review of your answers, with the incorrectly answered questions first, followed by the correctly answered questions:
1. Question ID: 94849629 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Which of the following would be considered 'passive activity' income?
    A. Portfolio income.
    B. Alaska Permanent Fund dividends.
    C. Rental income received by a taxpayer who is not a real estate professional.
    D. Cancellation of debt income.
C:
Generally, a passive activity is any rental activity OR any business in which the taxpayer does not materially participate. Nonpassive activities are businesses in which the taxpayer works on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis. Passive activity income also does NOT include:
    Portfolio income, such as interest, dividends, annuities, and royalties not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business, or gain or loss from the disposition of property that produces these types of income or that is held for investment.
    Personal service income. This includes salaries, wages, commissions, self-employment income from trade or business activities in which the taxpayer materially participated, deferred compensation, taxable Social Security and other retirement benefits, and payments from partnerships to partners for personal services.
    Any income from intangible property, such as a patent, copyright, or literary, musical, or artistic composition, if the taxpayer’s personal efforts significantly contributed to the creation of the property.
    State, local, and foreign income tax refunds.
    Income from a covenant not to compete.
    Alaska Permanent Fund dividends.
    Cancellation of debt income, if at the time the debt is discharged, the debt is not allocated to passive activities.
To learn more about passive activity income, refer to Publication 925, Passive Activities and At-Risk Rules.
2. Question ID: 94849567 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Serenity owns a condo in Hawaii. She lives in the home most of the year and uses it as her primary residence. While she was away visiting friends, she rented her condo for 13 days, charging $100 per day for a total of $1,300. She also had $320 of expenses during that time. How should this rental income be reported?
    A. She should report the income as ordinary income on Form 1040. The expenses are deductible as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A, if she itemizes deductions.
    B. She should report all the rental income. She can deduct $320 of expenses on Schedule E.
    C. The income is not taxable and does not need to be reported. The expenses are not deductible. 
    D. She can deduct the expenses. The rental income is not taxable.
C:
She does not report any of the income or expenses based on the exception for minimal rental use. If a taxpayer rents a main home or vacation home for fewer than 15 days, she does not have to recognize any of the income as taxable. She also cannot deduct any rental expenses. This is called the “15-day rule” or “minimal rental use”. For more examples, refer to Publication 527, Residential Rental Property.
3. Question ID: 95033973 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Roque, who is single, owns a rental duplex. He actively participates in the rental activity by collecting rent and performing repairs, but he is not a real estate professional. In the current year, Roque had a loss of $29,000 on this rental activity on Schedule E. He had no other passive income. His income from wages was $90,000. How much of the rental loss can Roque deduct on his current year tax return?
    A. $4,000
    B. $29,000
    C. $25,000
    D. $0
C:
Roque can deduct $25,000 of rental losses. The remaining amount, $4,000 ($29,000 - $25,000), can be carried over to the following year. A special rule allows taxpayers deduct up to $25,000 of rental losses from rental real estate activities in which they actively participate. This “special allowance” is an exception to the general rule disallowing losses in excess of income from passive activities. The $25,000 deduction is phased out when a taxpayer’s MAGI is from $100,000 to $150,000 and phased out completely when a taxpayer's MAGI is over $150,000.
5. Question ID: 94849517 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Fantine owns a residential rental property in addition to her primary residence. She pays mortgage interest and property taxes on both properties and receives a separate Form 1098 for each. How should this mortgage interest be reported on her individual tax return?
    A. The mortgage interest and taxes for both properties should be listed as an adjustment to income on Form 1040.
    B. The mortgage interest and taxes for the rental property should be listed as rental expenses on Schedule E, and the mortgage interest and taxes for the primary residence should be listed on Schedule A as itemized deductions.
    C. The mortgage interest and taxes for both properties should be listed as itemized deductions on Schedule A.
    D. The mortgage interest for the rental property should be listed on Schedule E. The mortgage interest for the primary residence and the property taxes for both properties should be listed on Schedule A.
B:
Fantine needs to report the mortgage interest and taxes that she paid on two separate schedules. The mortgage interest and taxes for the rental property should be listed on Schedule E. Rental income is reported on Schedule E and is offset by various deductions, including mortgage interest and property taxes paid. The mortgage interest and taxes for the primary residence should be listed on Schedule A as an itemized deduction.
6. Question ID: 98939195 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Eduardo owns an interest in three limited partnerships. He is only an investor (a limited partner) and has no involvement in the running of the business. One of the partnerships is profitable, and the other two are not profitable. Eduardo also earned $36,000 in wages from a part-time job. Based on these figures, calculate Eduardo's passive loss carryover on his individual return.
    Oil and Gas Partnership #1: $4,000 profit
    Medical Research Partnership #2: ($9,000 loss)
    Wind Energy Partnership #3: ($16,000 loss)
    A. $6,000 carryover loss.
    B. $0 carryover loss. He can offset his wages. 
    C. $21,000 carryover loss
    D. $15,000 carryover loss
C:
Eduardo has a $21,000 carryover loss. Net loss = ($9,000)+ ($16,000) + $4,000 = ($21,000). The full $21,000 passive activity loss for the taxable year is disallowed, and cannot offset his wages (it is not a rental activity, and therefore not eligible for the special $25,000 'rental loss allowance'). All the losses must be carried forward to a following year to offset future passive income, or until the taxpayer disposes of the activity. Based on an example from Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules. 
7. Question ID: 94849526 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Stephen, a landlord, made several repairs and improvements to his rental house. He spent $13,500 to install permanent tile in all of the bedrooms, $1,200 to repaint the exterior of the home, $170 to replace the broken faucet in the bathroom, and $590 to replace several damaged shingles on the roof. How much of these costs must he depreciate?
    A. $14,200
    B. $14,960
    C. $13,500
    D. $14,790
C:
Only the cost of the flooring would have to be depreciated, and it would be depreciated over 27.5 years. The rest of the costs can be expensed as repairs, including the painting of the exterior. Most flooring is considered to be permanently affixed. These types of flooring include hardwood, tile, vinyl and glued-down carpet. Per Publication 527 Residential Rental Property, permanent flooring such as tile or hardwood is depreciated over a period of 27.5 years. However, flooring subject to more wear and tear, such as carpeting, can be depreciated over 5 years.
9. Question ID: 94849541 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Antwan is single. He has the following income and losses during the year:
    Wages: $55,000
    Passive activity income from a limited partnership: $4,000
    Passive loss from a rental real estate activity (in which he actively participated): $6,000
Which of the following statements is correct?
    A. The first $4,000 of Antwan’s $6,000 passive loss offsets his passive income. He can deduct the remaining $2,000 to reduce taxation of his wages.
    B. He cannot deduct the passive loss to reduce taxation of his wages.
    C. He must carry over his loss to the next tax year.
    D. He cannot offset the rental loss against the passive income from the partnership because it is not the same type of passive activity.
A:
Antwan can use $4,000 of his rental loss to offset the passive activity income from the limited partnership. The remaining $2,000 loss can be deducted to reduce taxation of his wages.
Note: A taxpayer can deduct up to $25,000 per year of losses for rental real estate activities in which he actively participates. This special allowance is an exception to the general rule of disallowing losses from passive activities in excess of passive activity income. This $25,000 allowance is only allowed for rental activities. However, there are income limitations. If modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds $100,000 ($50,000 if MFS), the allowance is limited to 50% of the difference between $150,000 ($75,000 if MFS) and MAGI. If MAGI is $150,000 or more ($75,000 or more if MFS), the losses are disallowed and must be carried forward.
10. Question ID: 94855000 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Peter owns a lake cottage that he bought last year, intending to use the home as a vacation property for himself. In the current year, he rented the cottage for 10 days to a stranger, and Peter used the cottage for 20 days for his own personal use. The cottage was not used the rest of the year, and sat empty. Peter had rental income of $1,000 and he paid $450 for repairs because his renter broke a window. How should he report these activities on his tax return?
    A. $1,000 income, $450 expense on Schedule C
    B. $0 income, $0 expense (it does not have to be reported)
    C. $1,000 reported as 'other income' and no rental expenses would be permitted.
    D. $1,000 income, $450 expense on Schedule E
B:
Peter would report $0 income, and $0 expenses (i.e., this rental activity does not have to be reported). If you rent out a personal dwelling for less than 15 days during the tax year, this is considered 'Minimal Rental Use.' This is a special rule that applies, if the property qualifies as a residence and is rented for less than 15 days during the year, then the rental income is not taxable, and no expenses would be deductible.

11. Question ID: 94850305 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Joshua is unmarried and works full time as a college professor. He is not a real estate professional, but he does own a residential rental that he manages himself. Joshua earned $120,000 in salary at his job, and a ($31,000) loss from his rental real estate activities in which he actively participated. He reports the rental on Schedule E. He had no other income or loss for the year. Based on this information, figure out his passive loss carryover.
    A. $16,000
    B. $15,000
    C. $31,000
    D. $6,000
A:
When Joshua files his return, he can deduct only $15,000 of his passive activity loss. He must carry over the remaining $16,000 passive activity loss to the following year. He must figure his deduction and carryover as follows:
Adjusted gross income 	$120,000
Minus amount not subject to phaseout 	($100,000)
Amount subject to phaseout rule 	$20,000
Multiply by 50% 	X 50% 
Reduction to 'special allowance' 	$10,000
Maximum 'special allowance' 	$25,000
Minus reduction 	$10,000
Adjusted 'Special allowance' 	$15,000
Passive loss from rental activity 	$31,000
Deduction allowable in the current year 	($15,000)
Amount of losses that must be carried forward 	$16,000
Based directly on an example in Publication 925. 
12. Question ID: 94849631 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Ivan buys an apartment building for $160,000 on January 10. He plans to rent it out to long-term tenants. The latest real estate tax assessment on the property allocates 85% of the value to the building and 15% to the land. What is his basis for depreciation on Schedule E?
    A. $24,000
    B. $160,000
    C. $136,000
    D. $0.
C:
Ivan's basis for depreciation is $136,000 (85% × $160,000). When determining the basis for calculating depreciation, the cost basis of the land and building need to be calculated separately. The basis of the land is not subject to depreciation.
14. Question ID: 95033971 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
What type of rental property is never depreciated?
    A. Undeveloped land.
    B. Commercial buildings.
    C. Residential rentals.
    D. Land improvements.
A:
The cost of land is never depreciated, even if it is used in rental activity (for example, rented farmland, or undeveloped land that is used as an overflow parking lot). Land improvements, such as fencing, paved parking areas, and outdoor lighting, may be depreciated.
15. Question ID: 94850304 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Angelo, an unmarried taxpayer, owns a rental property that he actively manages himself. He collects the rents and chooses the tenants. He also works full-time as a math tutor. Angelo had the following income and loss during the tax year.
Salary from his tutoring job 	$42,300
Dividends 	300
Interest from a CD 	1,400
Rental loss 	(5,000)
The rental loss came from the house, which he owns. Although he actively participated in the rental activity, he is not a real estate professional. Based on this information, how much of the rental loss is Angelo permitted to deduct against his other taxable income in the current year?
    A. Up to $3,000 in losses, the maximum capital loss limit for an individual taxpayer. 
    B. He may not deduct any of the losses in the current year, because he has no passive activity income to offset. The full amount must be carried over to future years. 
    C. He may deduct the full amount of his losses ($5,000) against his wages. 
    D. Up to $1,700 in losses, to offset the amount of his dividends and interest ($300 + $1,400)
C:
He may deduct the full amount of his losses ($5,000) against his wages. The rental loss came from a house he owned. He advertised and rented the house to the current tenant himself. He also collected the rents and did the repairs or hired someone to do them. Even though the rental loss is a loss from a passive activity, he can use the entire loss to offset his other income because he 'actively participated' in the activity. This example is based directly on a scenario in Publication 925. 
Note: Special $25,000 allowance: If you or your spouse actively participated in a passive rental real estate activity, the amount of the passive activity loss that’s disallowed is decreased and you therefore can deduct up to $25,000 of loss from the activity from your nonpassive income. This special allowance is an exception to the general rule disallowing the passive activity loss. Similarly, you can offset credits from the activity against the tax on up to $25,000 of nonpassive income after taking into account any losses allowed under this exception. 
18. Question ID: 98939168 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Jenny and Blaze are married and file jointly. Jenny earns $80,000 as a registered nurse. Blaze earns $92,000 as a school administrator. They co-own and manage a residential rental together. They actively participate in the rental activity, but neither is a real estate professional. The rental activity is not profitable, and Jenny and Blaze incur a ($29,000) loss on Schedule E. Based on these facts, what is the maximum amount of rental losses that Jenny and Blaze can deduct from their nonpassive income (their wages)?
    A. $12,500
    B. $25,000
    C. $0
    D. $29,000
C:
They cannot deduct any of their rental losses. Under the passive activity rules, you can deduct up to $25,000 in passive losses against your ordinary income (W-2 wages) if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is $100,000 or less. This deduction phases out $1 for every $2 of MAGI above $100,000 until $150,000 when it is completely phased out. Blaze and Jenny's wages exceed the maximum threshold ($80,000 wages + $92,000 wages = $172,000). Their passive loss must be carried forward to future tax years to offset any passive income.
Note: If their income drops below the threshold in future years, (for example, if one of them stops working) or, if they decide to dispose of the activity (they sell the rental) then the carryover losses will be released at that time. Learn more about the special rules for rental losses in Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules. 
20. Question ID: 94849651 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Norbert purchased his home six years ago for $250,000. The purchase price was allocatable to fair market values of (1) $50,000 for the underlying land and (2) $200,000 for the house. Norbert paid an additional $18,000 for adding an additional bathroom to the home. Norbert moves out of the home on June 1, because of a job transfer. Instead of selling the home, he decides to rent it out. A tenant moved in on October 1, 2023. The FMV of the property on October 1 was $310,000, comprised of $65,000 for the land and $245,000 for the house. He paid $2,400 for plumbing repairs during November after his tenant discovered a water leak in the garage. Based upon the information listed, what is the basis on which depreciation should be calculated during the rental period?
    A. $270,400
    B. $245,000
    C. $250,000
    D. $218,000
D:
The basis for depreciation is the lesser of fair market value or the taxpayer’s adjusted basis on the date the property was converted to rental use. The adjusted basis on October 1 was $218,000 (original cost of $200,000 + improvements of $18,000). Since this amount was lower than the FMV of the home ($245,000) on the same date, the lower figure must be used as the basis for depreciation on the property. The basis of the land is not subject to depreciation (land is never depreciated). The plumbing repairs are deductible as a current expense and are not depreciated. Instead, the repairs would simply be deductible as an expense on Schedule E.
21. Question ID: 94815927 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Antonio is unmarried and owns a residential rental property. He is not a real estate professional. He reports his rental income on Schedule E. In the current year, his wage income was $82,000, and his losses from the rental property were $27,000. He actively participated in the rental activity. How much of the rental loss can he deduct on his individual tax return?
    A. $27,000
    B. $0, the losses are completely disallowed by the passive activity rules.
    C. $25,000, with a $2,000 loss carryover.
    D. $25,000 with no carryover.
C:
Antonio can deduct up to $25,000 of his rental losses from his active income. The disallowed amount ($2,000) can be carried over to the next year. If a taxpayer actively participates in a passive rental real estate activity that produces a loss, the taxpayer can deduct the loss from non-passive income, up to $25,000. This $25,000 allowance is only allowed for rental activities. However, there are income limitations. If modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds $100,000 ($50,000 if MFS), the allowance is limited to 50% of the difference between $150,000 ($75,000 if MFS) and MAGI. If MAGI is $150,000 or more ($75,000 or more if MFS), the losses are disallowed and must be carried forward. To learn more about rental losses and passive loss limits, refer to Publication 925, Passive Activities and At-Risk Rules.
22. Question ID: 94849596 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Tony lives near a popular football arena. He rents his main home during sporting events for 12 days during the tax year and earns $2,500. During the time he rents his home, he stays across town with his parents. Tony does not rent his home at any other time during the year. How should this income be reported?
    A. The income is taxed as rental income and should be reported on Schedule E.
    B. The income is not taxable and does not need to be reported.
    C. The income is taxed as ordinary income and should be reported as “other income” on Form 1040. The income is not subject to self-employment tax.
    D. The income is taxed as ordinary income and is subject to self-employment tax.
B:
The income is not taxable and does not need to be reported. There is an exception when a taxpayer rents his primary residence for fewer than 15 days during the year. That period is not treated as rental activity. This is also called the “15 day rule” or the exception for “Minimal Rental Use”. The taxpayer is not required to report the income and is not allowed to deduct the rental expenses.
23. Question ID: 94849726 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Rajeev lives in a community where there is a large music festival for two weeks during August every year. He usually rents out his home for these 14 days and goes to visit his sister. In the current year, he had $6,000 of rental income and $700 of expenses from the 14 rental days. How should Rajeev report this income and expense on his tax return?
    A. $6,000 of rental income and $700 of expenses on Schedule E.
    B. No reporting is required of either the rental income or rental expenses.
    C. $6,000 of rental income added to his other income on Form 1040; $700 of expenses deducted on Schedule A.
    D. $6,000 of rental income added to his other income on Form 1040; $28 (4% of 365 days) of expenses deducted on Schedule A.
B:
The primary function of a home that is rented for less than 15 days during the year is not considered to be rental, and it should not be reported on Schedule E. This is called the '15-day rule' or 'minimal rental use'. Rajeev is not required to report the rental income and expenses from this activity. Any regular expenses such as mortgage interest and property taxes are reported as normally allowed for a home on Schedule A, but no expenses related to the rental activity can be deducted.
24. Question ID: 94849675 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Deandre owns a residential rental tri-plex and actively participates in the rental activity. The cost basis of the building is $164,000. According to the property tax rolls, the value of the property is allocated as follows:
    $124,000 allocated to the building.
    $40,000 allocated to the land.
The building was placed into service four years ago. Deandre chose to depreciate the building using MACRS straight-line depreciation. Residential rental property is always depreciated over 27.5 years. Based on this information, how much depreciation expense can Deandre claim per year?
    A. $4,509
    B. $5,964
    C. $0
    D. $1,456
A:
The depreciable basis for the building is limited to the value of the building ($124,000). The basis of land is never depreciated. Since residential rental property is depreciated over 27.5 years, a basis of $124,000 would generate depreciation of $4,509 per year ($124,000/27.5 years). Rental activity is reported on Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss. The depreciation of rentals is reported on Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization.
25. Question ID: 94850303 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Thomas owns a rental property in Miami, Florida, that he rents out to short-term tenants. Thomas provides services like fresh linens, fresh towels daily, and a complimentary breakfast for his guests. What form should he report this income?
    A. Schedule D
    B. Schedule E
    C. Schedule C
    D. Schedule F
C:
Thomas should report the rental income on Schedule C. If a property owner provides “substantial services” to short-term renters, the IRS says that the rental activity should be reported on Schedule C. The IRS defines substantial services as services generally provided to guests that are primarily for their convenience and not normally provided with a rental. For example, meals, daily laundry, and maid services.
26. Question ID: 97473769 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Gary and Betty are married but have lived apart for 5 years. They both file MFS returns. Gary owns a residential rental that he manages himself. His wages for the year were $38,000, and he had no other taxable income. He incurred a ($5,000) loss on his rental property. How much of his rental loss is he allowed to deduct on his tax return?
    A. $0, because he is filing MFS
    B. $3,000
    C. $5,000
    D. $2,500
C:
Gary can deduct the entire rental loss against his wages. This is because, even though he files MFS, he is allowed to take the full rental loss because (1) he did not live with his spouse, (2) his MAGI was under $50,000, and (3) his rental losses were less than $12,500 (one-half of the “special allowance”).
27. Question ID: 98939161 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Thomas is unmarried and works full-time as a bank manager, earning $82,000 a year. He also owns a residential rental which he reports on Schedule E. He actively participates in the rental activity, but he is not a real estate professional. This year, he was forced to evict his tenants from his rental, which ended up costing him thousands of dollars in legal fees. Thomas ends up incurring a ($32,000) loss on Schedule E. Based on these facts, what is the maximum amount of rental losses that Thomas can deduct from his nonpassive income?
    A. $0
    B. $12,500
    C. $25,000
    D. $32,000
C:
The maximum amount of rental losses that he can deduct from nonpassive income would be $25,000. Under the passive activity rules you can deduct up to $25,000 in passive losses against your ordinary income (W-2 wages) if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is $100,000 or less. Since Thomas earned less than $100,000 in wages and had no other income sources for the year, he is permitted to deduct up to $25,000 of his rental losses in the current year. The remaining rental losses would be carried to the following year, where the same rules and limits would apply. Learn more about the special rules for rental losses in Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules. 
28. Question ID: 94849524 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Which of the following is not rental income in the year received?
    A. Refundable security deposit 
    B. One year of pre-paid rent, paid in advance by the tenant
    C. Repairs paid by the tenant in lieu of rent
    D. Payment to cancel the remaining lease
A:
A security deposit is not rental income if the deposit is meant to be returned to a tenant at the end of the lease agreement. 
30. Question ID: 94849700 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Ignatius owns one-half of a residential rental house. His cousin, Marina, owns the other half. The house is rented out all year to long-term tenants. Last year, Ignatius paid $968 out of pocket for repairing a broken water pipe on the property. How should this expense be treated on his tax return?
    A. He can deduct $484 (50% × $968) as a rental expense on Schedule E. He is entitled to reimbursement for the remaining half from the co-owner.
    B. He can deduct $484 (50% × $968) as a rental expense on Schedule E. The other 50% he can claim as an adjustment to income on his Form 1040.
    C. He can deduct $968 as a rental expense on Schedule E.
    D. He can deduct $968 as a business expense on Schedule C.
A:
If you own a part interest in rental property, you can deduct expenses you paid according to your percentage of ownership. Therefore, Ignatius can deduct $484 (50% X $968) as a rental expense. He is also entitled to reimbursement for the remaining half from the co-owner. See Publication 527, Residential Rental Property, for more information and to see similar examples. 
31. Question ID: 97473768 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Frank owns a residential rental property that he actively manages himself. He collects rental income of $20,600 during the year. The rental expenses total $16,000, plus $12,000 of depreciation. He earns $98,500 in wages during the year, and has no other activity for the year. He files as single. What is his allowable rental loss on Schedule E?
    A. $7,400
    B. $28,000
    C. $0
    D. $10,600
A:
Frank has a net loss on his rental of $7,400 ($20,600 rental income - $28,000 ($16,000 rental expenses + $12,000 depreciation). The loss is permitted because he actively participates in the activity, and his income is below the threshold for the special loss allowance. He also can deduct the $7,400 loss from his other income (i.e., his wages).
32. Question ID: 94849531 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Yahir and Taliyah are married and file jointly. Yahir earned $85,000 of wages and Taliyah had net income of $4,000 on her Schedule F, from selling eggs and chickens that she raised herself. They had interest income of $700. Taliyah also had a $32,000 loss from a rental real estate activity in which she actively participated. She is not a real estate professional. Based on this information, how much of the rental loss can they deduct on their joint tax return?
    A. $0
    B. $25,000
    C. $32,000
    D. $4,000
B:
Since Taliyah actively participated in the rental activity and their adjusted gross income is less than $100,000, they are allowed to deduct $25,000 of rental losses against other income. A special rule allows taxpayers deduct up to $25,000 of losses from rental real estate in which you actively participate. This is often called the '$25,000 rental loss allowance'. The $25,000 allowance is phased out when modified adjusted gross income is from $100,000 to $150,000, resulting in no deduction if the taxpayer's AGI is above $150,000. They can carry forward the remainder of the rental losses to the following tax year, subject to the same limitation.

He is not currently a citizen or resident of the US, but he has a Social Security number because he worked in the US decades ago. How should Marcas report his rental income?
    A. Marcas should file Form 1040-NR.
    B. Since he has a valid SSN, Marcas can choose whether to file Form 1040-NR or Form 1040.
    C. Marcas does not need to file any US tax return.
    D. Marcas should file Form 1040.
A:
In order to report his income, Marcas will need to file Form 1040-NR. Just because someone has an SSN, doesn't mean they are a resident of the US for tax purposes. Many nonresident aliens have a Social Security number for various reasons. 
4. Question ID: 94849691 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Samuel owns a ten-unit apartment building and charges $800 rent per month for each unit. Nine units were rented for the entire year. A tenant occupied the tenth unit from January 1 to June 30. The tenant did considerable damage to the apartment so the tenant’s security deposit of $500 was not refunded to her when she moved out. Another tenant rented the apartment for $800 a month with a one-year lease, beginning September 1, 2023. The new tenant paid the first and last months’ rent and a refundable security deposit of $500. Disregarding any allowable expenses, how much gross rental income must Samuel report on Schedule E for the year?
    A. $94,400
    B. $96,200
    C. $95,700
    D. $95,200
C:
Samuel must include all the rental income, including the forfeited security deposit he retains for the damage to the unit. The refundable security deposit from the new tenant is not included in Samuel’s income because it is refundable. The answer is calculated as follows:
    $800 rent × 12 months × 9 units: $86,400.
    $800 rent × 6 months for tenant from Jan through June: $4,800.
    Security deposit retained for tenant who moved out: $500.
    $800 rent × 4 months for new tenant from September through December: $3,200.
    Advance rent paid by new tenant: $800.
    Total Rental Income $95,700

    B. Rental of an empty lot for parking overflow. 
    C. Rental of a rental home to long-term tenants. 
    D. Rental of personal property, such as vehicles and equipment. 
D:
Taxpayers generally use Schedule E, to report income and expenses related to real estate rentals. 'Real estate' can mean a residential rental home, an office building, or an empty lot. The rental of personal property (such as vehicles, equipment, etc.) is reported differently, however.
    Taxpayers should report income and expenses related to personal property rentals on Schedule C, (if they are in the business of renting personal property).
    Taxpayers should report income and expenses on Schedule 1 (as 'other income'), if they are not in the business of renting personal property (this might include someone who rented their own vehicle, RV, or a boat for a short time).
Study Tip: 'Personal property' is an accounting term that is commonly defined as any property that is not attached to the land or to structures on real estate. The main characteristic of personal property is that it is movable, unlike real property or real estate. To see more information about personal property rentals, see IRS Topic No. 414 Rental Income and Expenses.
13. Question ID: 94849626 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
LuAnn rents a room in her home to a college student for nine months of the year. The student pays $600 a month in rent. The home has five rooms in the house. Each room is approximately the same size. LuAnn paid the following expenses in the current year:
    Mortgage interest: $9,000
    Homeowner’s insurance: $1,000
    Property taxes: $2,000
    Utilities: $1,000
What amounts should LuAnn report as rental income and deduct as rental expenses on her Schedule E?
    A. Rental income: $3,450; deduction: $0.
    B. Rental income: $5,400; deduction: $13,000.
    C. Rental income: $5,400; deduction: $2,600.
    D. Rental income: $5,400; deduction: $1,950.
D:
LuAnn must report the full amount of rental income collected: (9 × $600 =$5,400). Her expenses total $13,000. Because the student uses one-fifth (20%) of her house, she can deduct 20% of the expenses ($13,000 × .20 = $2,600), but only for the nine months during which the student rented the room. Thus, the expenses must be further allocated for the period of occupancy (9/12 months = 75% × $2,600 = $1,950).
A taxpayer who rents part of a property must divide certain expenses between the part of the property used for rental purposes and the part used for personal purposes, as though there were actually two separate pieces of property. Expenses related to the part of the property used for rental purposes can be deducted as rental expenses on Schedule E. This includes a portion of expenses that normally are nondeductible personal expenses, such as painting the outside of a house. If an expense applies to both rental use and personal use, such as a heating bill for the entire house, the taxpayer must allocate the expense between the two. The two most common methods for allocating such expenses are based on:
    The number of rooms in the house, and
    The square footage of the house.

Geraldine owns three rental properties, which all have long-term tenants. She also has a full-time job as a teacher. Which form would she use to report her rental income and losses?
    A. Schedule A
    B. Schedule D
    C. Schedule C
    D. Schedule E
D:
Rental income and expenses are reported on Schedule E, which is then attached to the taxpayer's Form 1040. Rental income is any payment received for the use or occupation of property, and is generally passive activity income.
17. Question ID: 94849637 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Athene has a cabin in Lake Tahoe that she uses as a vacation home to go skiing, and also a rental. She rented out her ski home for 80 days during the year and used it personally for 20 days. She paid $2,000 for repairs and $4,000 for utilities. She received rental income of $16,000. What was Athene’s net rental income, after applying her allowable expenses?
    A. $16,000
    B. $0
    C. $10,000
    D. $11,200
D:
Athene's property is subject to special tax treatment because it is not strictly a rental, it is also a personal home. When a taxpayer has a residence (whether a main home or a second home) that is used personally at certain times and rented out at other times, she must divide her expenses between rental use and personal use. Rental expenses generally will be no more than a taxpayer’s total expenses multiplied by the following fraction: the denominator is the total number of days the dwelling is used and the numerator is the total number of days actually rented at a fair rental price. In this case, the home was used a total of 100 days and was rented for 80 days (80%). Only 80% ($6,000 × .80 = $4,800) of the expenses are deductible, so Athene’s net rental income after applying her allowable expenses is $11,200.
19. Question ID: 94849701 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Kaitlin owns a residential rental property. The sewage and water bill is in Kaitlin's name because she is the owner of the property. Her tenant pays the sewage bill for her rental property and deducts the amount from the normal rent payment. Under the terms of the lease, her tenant doesn’t have to pay this bill. How should Kaitlin treat this transaction on her Schedule E?
    A. No reporting is required, since the amounts paid by the tenant are a 'wash'.
    B. The property owner can deduct the utility payment made by the tenant as a rental expense on Schedule E.
    C. The property owner must report the utility payment made by the tenant as rental income on Schedule E. No amounts are deductible in this scenario.
    D. She must include the utility bill paid by the tenant as a rental payment in her rental income. She can deduct the utility payment made by the tenant as a rental expense.
D:
If your tenant pays any of your expenses, those payments are rental income. Because you must include this amount in income, you can also deduct the expenses if they are deductible rental expenses. If a tenant pays the water and sewage bill for a rental property, the taxpayer (i.e., the property owner) must include the utility bill paid by the tenant and any amount received as a rent payment in their rental income. The property owner can deduct the utility payment made by the tenant as a rental expense on Schedule E. See Publication 527, Residential Rental Property, for more information and to see similar examples. 
29. Question ID: 94815968 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Cecile is a limited partner in two different partnerships. Cecile also owns a residential rental that she manages herself, but she is not a real estate professional. All the activities generated a profit for the year. Where should Cecile report the income she receives from these activities?
    A. The pass-through income from the partnership would be reported on Schedule D. The rental would be reported on Schedule E.
    B. The pass-through income from the partnership would be reported on Schedule C. The rental would be reported on Schedule E.
    C. All the income should be reported on Schedule C.
    D. All the income should be reported on Schedule E.
D:
All the income should be reported on Schedule E (Form 1040). Taxpayers use Schedule E to report income (or loss) from rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, estates, trusts, and residual interests in REMICs.
33. Question ID: 94849599 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)
Which of the following is NOT rental income in the year received?
    A. Payment to cancel the remaining lease.
    B. Pre-paid rent (rent paid in advance)
    C. Repairs paid by the tenant in lieu of rent.
    D. Security deposit, equal to one month’s rent, to be refunded at the end of the lease if the building passes inspection.
D:
A refundable security deposit received from a tenant is not rental income. A security deposit is money that is given to a lender, seller, or landlord as proof of intent and may be used to pay for damages caused by a renter. A landlord should not include a security deposit in their income on Schedule E, if they may be required to return it to the tenant at the end of the lease.

1. Question ID: 94850170 (Topic: Other Taxable Income)
All of the following types of settlements from lawsuits are taxable income except:
    A. Unlawful discrimination award.
    B. Settlements for loss in value of property that are less than the adjusted basis of the property.
    C. Punitive damages.
    D. Interest on a lawsuit settlement.
B:
Settlements for loss in value of property that are less than the adjusted basis of a taxpayer’s property are not taxable and generally do not need to be reported. A taxpayer must reduce his basis in the property by the amount of the settlement. If the property settlement exceeds the adjusted basis in the property, the excess is taxable income. The taxability of other types of settlements varies. For instance, in employment-related lawsuits such as unlawful discrimination or involuntary termination, the portion of the proceeds that is for lost wages is taxable. Punitive damages and interest on settlements also are generally taxable. Settlements for physical injuries or illness are generally not taxable, although the proceeds for emotional distress often are (unless the emotional distress originates from physical injury or illness).

    B. $37,030
    C. $26,030
    D. $60,030
A:
The wages, interest, dividends, and lottery winnings are taxable income ($26,000 + $30 + $4,000 + $10,000 = $40,030). Child support, inheritances, and worker's compensation are nontaxable income. The gambling losses would be deductible, but only as an itemized deduction on Schedule A. 
4. Question ID: 94815930 (Topic: Other Taxable Income)
Garland has a partial interest in several partnerships. He is merely a passive investor and does not materially participate in any of the businesses. The income is reported to Garland on (multiple) Schedules K-1. During the year, Garland had the following results from these passive activities:
    French-style Cafe: $56,000 loss.
    Ice cream store: $32,000 loss.
    Nutrition supplement store: $18,000 loss.
    Doughnut shop: $90,000 income.
What is the tax treatment of Garland's ownership of these businesses, and how would the amounts be reported on his Form 1040?
    A. Taxable income of $90,000 and deductible losses of $106,000. The amounts would be reported on Schedule C. 
    B. Deductible capital loss of $16,000 in the tax year. The amounts would be reported on Schedule D. 
    C. No taxable income; carryover of passive activity losses of $16,000 to the following year. The amounts would be reported on Schedule E. 
    D. Taxable income of $90,000; carryover of passive activity losses of $106,000 to the following year. The amounts would be reported on Schedule E. 
C:
Under the passive activity limitation rules, Garland cannot deduct the full amount of his losses against taxable income from other sources. Since he had passive activity income of $90,000 during the year, he can offset losses up to that amount. He can carry over the remaining passive activity losses of $16,000 to the following year. Schedule E is used to record income and loss for partners in a partnership, whether the activity is passive or not.

Clarence is 67 and unmarried. He has no dependents and lives alone. During the year, he sold investments and realized a taxable capital gain of $96,050. He also received $11,500 of Social Security benefits. He has no other taxable income for the year. What is the maximum taxable amount of his Social Security benefits?
    A. $9,775, a maximum of 85% of his benefits would be taxable. 
    B. Insufficient information to determine the answer.
    C. $11,500, all of his benefits would be taxable. 
    D. $0, none of his benefits would be taxable. 
A:
Regardless of a taxpayer’s other taxable income, the maximum amount that can ever be taxable on net Social Security benefits is 85%. Therefore, the answer is $9,775 ($11,500 × 85%). This is the maximum amount of his Social Security that would be taxed.
3. Question ID: 94849611 (Topic: Social Security Income)
Which of the following is not taxable as 'earned income'?
    A. Union strike benefits.
    B. Social security and railroad retirement benefits
    C. Self-employment income of a statutory employee.
    D. Long-term disability benefits received prior to minimum retirement age.
B:
Social security and railroad retirement benefits are not considered 'earned income'. Earned income includes all the taxable income and wages a taxpayer receives from working. Taxable earned income includes:
    Wages, salaries, tips, and other taxable employee pay.
    Union strike benefits.
    Long-term disability benefits received prior to minimum retirement age.
    Net earnings from self-employment.
Most government welfare benefits including food stamps, heating assistance programs, and non-federal assistance benefits from states or local agencies are exempt from federal taxation and not treated as 'earned income.' Worker’s compensation, which provides wage replacement and medical benefits to injured workers, is also not taxable.

1. Question ID: 94815908 (Topic: Taxable Recoveries)
Boldo received a state tax refund related to his prior-year return. He itemized deductions on Schedule A in the previous year and plans to itemize again in the current year. How does Boldo's state tax refund affect his current year tax return?
    A. Boldo must report his state tax refund as a reduction of his itemized deduction for state income taxes paid on his current year tax return.
    B. It does not. State tax refunds do not affect federal income taxes.
    C. Boldo must report his prior year state tax refund as income on his federal tax return in the current year.
    D. None of the above.
C:
Boldo must report his prior year state tax refund as income on his federal tax return in the current year. A state refund is included in federal gross income in the year it is received, but only if the taxpayer itemized deductions in the year to which the refund relates. If the taxpayer had claimed the standard deduction in the prior year, and thus received no benefit from the state income taxes paid, the related refund would not be taxable.
