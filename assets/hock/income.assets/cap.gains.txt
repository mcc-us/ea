This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 73% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Jason and his wife have a $4,500 capital loss carryover.  The capital loss of $11,500 on the stock sale is offset by the $4,000 capital gain passed through from the limited partnership investment, resulting in a net capital loss of $7,500. Jason and his wife can claim $3,000 of the loss on their current year return. The remaining $4,500 of capital loss must be carried over to the next year. The deduction for capital losses is limited to $3,000 ($1,500 for MFS) per year, with a carryforward of excess loss to future years.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 83% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

His net capital gain is $17,000. He realizes a $25,000 ($65,000 - $40,000) capital gain on the sale of the vase, which is offset by the capital loss of $8,000 ($20,000 - $12,000.) He may offset the gains with the losses from the sale of both collectibles. The gain is long-term, because he held the collectibles for more than one year. A "collectible" is defined by the IRS as:

Artwork, rugs or antiques,
Precious metals or gemstones,
Stamps, comic books, collectible cards, like baseball cards
Alcoholic beverages (like premium wines),
Gold and silver coins, and antique coins

He will be subject to a long-term capital gains tax rate of up to 28%. To learn more about this topic, see Topic No. 409 Capital Gains and Losses.

C. Geneva recognizes $2,000 capital loss; Henry recognizes $7,000 capital gain.
D. Geneva recognizes $2,000 capital loss; Henry recognizes $8,000 capital gain.

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 47% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

This is a related party transaction, and special rules apply. Geneva recognizes $0 capital loss; Henry recognizes $6,000 capital gain. This is because Geneva cannot claim a loss on the sale of stock to her own brother. Losses from sale or exchange of property, directly or indirectly, are disallowed between related parties. When the property is later sold to an unrelated party, any previously disallowed loss may be used to offset gain on that transaction. However, since Henry sold the stock at a profit, he would be able to use the basis of the original seller (his sister's basis was $10,000, this is called a "transferred basis") in order to calculate his own gain on the sale.

D. Long-term capital gain of $2,030.

Study Unit 7: Capital Gains and Losses covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 83% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Although the taxpayer owned the 10 shares he received as a nontaxable stock dividend for only a few days, all the stock has a long-term holding period. Stock acquired as a stock dividend has the same holding period as the original stock owned. Because he bought the stock for $1,500 and then sold it for $2,030 more than a year later, he has a long-term capital gain of $530 on the sale of the 610 shares.
