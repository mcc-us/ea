This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 53% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Settlements for loss in value of property that are less than the adjusted basis of a taxpayer’s property are not taxable and generally do not need to be reported. A taxpayer must reduce his basis in the property by the amount of the settlement. If the property settlement exceeds the adjusted basis in the property, the excess is taxable income. The taxability of other types of settlements varies. For instance, in employment-related lawsuits such as unlawful discrimination or involuntary termination, the portion of the proceeds that is for lost wages is taxable. Punitive damages and interest on settlements also are generally taxable. Settlements for physical injuries or illness are generally not taxable, although the proceeds for emotional distress often are (unless the emotional distress originates from physical injury or illness).

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 70% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Under the passive activity limitation rules, Garland cannot deduct the full amount of his losses against taxable income from other sources. Since he had passive activity income of $90,000 during the year, he can offset losses up to that amount. He can carry over the remaining passive activity losses of $16,000 to the following year. Schedule E is used to record income and loss for partners in a partnership, whether the activity is passive or not.
