<div>It
 is possible to be a U.S. resident alien and a nonresident alien in the 
same tax year. This usually occurs in the year the taxpayer arrives or 
departs from the United States. If so, the taxpayer may elect to be 
treated as a Dual Status Alien for this taxable year and a Resident 
Alien for the next taxable year if they meet certain tests. Dual status 
aliens determine their residency status under both the Internal Revenue 
Code and international tax treaties. A taxpayer cannot file a 
"dual-status" return on either a Form 1040-NR if the taxpayer is a 
resident alien at the end of the year. The taxpayer would need to file 
on Form 1040, and attach 1040-NR as a statement to the back of the Form
