Bruno would meet the tests to be Matthew's Qualifying Relative	D:<br>Yes, Bruno would meet the tests to be Matthew's Qualifying Relative. <br>- Although cousins are not considered 'family members' for the relationship test for qualifying relatives, the question stated that Bruno lived with Matthew all year.
