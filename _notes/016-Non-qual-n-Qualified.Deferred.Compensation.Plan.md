A nonqualified deferred compensation plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that allows employees to defer a portion of their current compensation to a future date. 

Unlike traditional retirement plans like 401(k)s, nonqualified plans are not subject to the same tax-favored treatment. 

**Key Features:**

* **Deferral of Income:** Employees can defer a portion of their current income to future years.
* **Tax Implications:** While the deferred compensation is not taxed in the year it's earned, it will be taxed as ordinary income **when it's paid out**.
* **Risk:** These plans can be riskier than qualified plans because they are not protected by ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act).
* **Flexibility:** Employers have flexibility in designing nonqualified plans.

**Common Types of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans:**

* **Deferred Compensation Plans:** These plans allow employees to defer a portion of their salary or bonus to future years.
* **Rabbi Trusts:** These are irrevocable trusts set up to hold funds for future payment to employees.
* **SERPs (Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans):** These plans are designed to provide additional retirement benefits to key executives.

It's important to note that nonqualified deferred compensation plans are subject to complex tax and regulatory rules.

Qualified deferred compensation plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that offers certain tax advantages to employees. These plans are subject to specific regulations under the **Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)**.

**Common Types**

* **401(k) Plans:** These are employer-sponsored retirement plans that allow employees to contribute a portion of their salary to the plan. Employers may also contribute to the plan.
* **403(b) Plans:** These plans are primarily for employees of public schools and certain tax-exempt organizations. They are similar to 401(k) plans.
* **457(b) Plans:** These plans are available to state and local government employees and certain non-profit organizations. They offer tax-deferred growth and can be a valuable retirement savings tool.

**Key Features**

* **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Contributions to the plan grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't owe income tax on the contributions or earnings until you withdraw the funds.
* **Employer Contributions:** Employers may contribute to the plan on behalf of employees.
* **Employee Contributions:** Employees can often make contributions to the plan as well.
* **Tax-Deferred Withdrawals:** When you withdraw funds from the plan, you'll pay income tax on the distribution, but you may also owe additional taxes or penalties, depending on your age and the type of plan.
