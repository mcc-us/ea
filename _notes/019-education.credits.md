### How to Claim the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) on Form 8863

- The U.S. provides for certain tax credits or deductions for higher education expenses

   - American Opportunity Tax Credit (IRS Form 8863)
   - Lifetime Learning Tax Credit (IRS Form 8863)

- American Opportunity Tax Credit

   - Covers the first 4 years of post-secondary education.
   - Generally, **preferable tax credit**, because of larger amounts and the credit is on a per student basis (for parents with multiple kids in college, can claim multiple credits in the same year)
   - The student must be pursuing a degree (they cannot simply be taking classes for fun or part of a non-degree program).
   - Credit up to $2,500 of education expenses. 
     - 100% of the first $2,000, and then 25% of expenses over 2k, but capped at 500.

- Lifetime Learning tax Credit

   - Credit can apply all the way through grad-school, so it is not limited to the first 4 years of college.
   - Credit is available on a per taxpayer basis (only one person can claim per year).
   - Can be claimed even if not pursuing a degree (i.e., just taking classes for fun)

- Example: John Doe is 20 years old and is enrolled as a full-time at a university studying Accounting. He is in his third year of college. John also works a full-time for a call center where he is allowed to work from home.

- Example 2: Jon received form 1098-T which shows his tuition for the 2023 calendar year totaled $5,200 and his W2 wages from his job were 32,000. Jon has already claimed the AOTC for the previous two years (Freshman & Sophomore).
