Here's an overview of each:

1. **Innocent Spouse Relief**, One party is innocent of a mistake made by the other.  
2. **Injured Spouse Relief**, One party is hurt by the others past debts. 

- **Key Differences**:
   - *Innocent Spouse Relief* (Form 8857): Addresses tax liability due to your **spouse's errors on the tax return**, and you want relief from the responsibility.  
   - *Injured Spouse Relief* (Form 8379): Addresses situations when **joint tax returns** are filed. You and your spouse have separate debts and one party is trying to reclaim their share of the refund.  


#### 1. Innocent Spouse Relief - Form 8857
   - **Purpose**: This relief is designed for a spouse who files jointly and ***later discovers*** that their partner **under-reported income OR claimed improper deductions or credits**. The innocent spouse can request relief from the responsibility of paying taxes, interest, and penalties associated with the erroneous return.
   - *One party is innocent of a mistake made by the other.*  
   - **When to File**: You file **Form 8857** if you believe you should not be held responsible for the tax liabilities of your spouse or ex-spouse, particularly when:
     - There’s an understatement of tax due to errors (e.g., unreported income or fraudulent deductions) on the joint return that you didn’t know about.
     - You acted in good faith and did not benefit from the improper tax advantages.
   - **Relief Types**:
     - Innocent Spouse Relief
     - Separation of Liability Relief
     - Equitable Relief

#### 2. Injured Spouse Relief - Form 8379
   - **Purpose**: This relief is for a spouse whose share of a joint tax refund is seized to pay the other spouse's past-due debts (such as child support, alimony, student loans, or back taxes). Injured spouse relief allows you to recover your portion of the refund.
   - *One party is hurt by the others past debts.*  
   - **When to File**: You file **Form 8379** if your joint tax refund has been applied to your spouse’s debt, but you are not responsible for that debt. Injured Spouse Relief will allow you to recover your portion of the refund that is unrelated to your spouse's debt.
