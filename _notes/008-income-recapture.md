Income recapture is a tax rule that requires taxpayers to pay ordinary income tax on any gain from the sale of certain assets, such as depreciated property or Section 1245(??) property. 

**How it works:**

When you sell a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted basis, the excess amount is a capital gain. However, **if the asset is subject to recapture rules, a portion of the gain may be taxed at ordinary income rates. This is because you've already received tax benefits from depreciating the asset over time.** 

**Common Examples of Recapture:**

* **Section 1245 Property:** Property like machinery and equipment. A portion of the gain on the sale of Section 1245 property *is recaptured as ordinary income*.
* **Section 1250 Property:** Typically real estate. Recapture rules apply to depreciation claimed on real estate, especially for accelerated depreciation methods (MACRS).
