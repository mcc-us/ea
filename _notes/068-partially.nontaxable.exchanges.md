A partially nontaxable exchange is when **you receive property PLUS unlike property or money.**

- Ex. **NOT Like for Like Exchange**

Basis of the property = the basis of the property you gave up, with RULES/Adjustments

1. Your **New Basis** = basis MINUS any money you receive or losses.

2. **New Basis** = basis PLUS any costs you incur or gains you recognize.

3. If the second party oo the exchange assumes your liabilities **THEN** treat the debt assumption as money you received in the exchange.
