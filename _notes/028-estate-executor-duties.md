title: Estate Executor Duties
---
 
 The executor of a taxable estate has several critical duties, including:

- **Identifying and gathering all the deceased person's assets:** This includes locating bank accounts, real estate, investments, personal belongings, and any other valuable possessions.
  
- **Paying debts and taxes:** The executor is responsible for paying all outstanding debts of the deceased, including mortgages, credit card bills, and medical expenses. This also includes filing and paying all necessary taxes, such as income tax, estate tax, and any applicable state taxes.

- **Distributing assets to beneficiaries:** Once all debts and taxes are paid, the executor must distribute the remaining assets to the beneficiaries according to the terms of the will or, if there is no will, according to state law.

- **Filing necessary tax returns:** The executor must file the necessary tax returns for the deceased and the estate, such as the final income tax return for the deceased and the estate tax return (if applicable).

- **Maintaining accurate records:** The executor must maintain detailed records of all transactions related to the estate, including receipts, invoices, and bank statements.
