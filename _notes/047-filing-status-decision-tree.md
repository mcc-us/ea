Step 1: Are you married?
- Yes → Go to Step 2
- No → File as Single or consider Head of Household (Go to Step 6)

Step 2: Did your spouse die this year?
- Yes → Go to Step 3
- No → Go to Step 4

Step 3: Did you remarry before the end of the year?
- Yes → File as Married Filing Jointly with your new spouse.
- No → File as Married Filing Jointly with your deceased spouse, OR as Married Filing Separately.

Step 4: Are you living with your spouse at the end of the year?
- Yes → File as Married Filing Jointly (MFJ) or Married Filing Separately (MFS) (if you prefer separate returns).
- No → Go to Step 5

Step 5: Did you live apart from your spouse for the last 6 months of the year, and did you pay more than half the cost of keeping up a home for a qualifying child or dependent?
