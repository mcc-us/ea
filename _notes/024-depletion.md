title: Depletion
---
 
#### Depletion is a tax deduction that allows businesses that extract natural resources (like oil, gas, timber, or minerals) to recover the cost of those resources over time.
 

- Key difference between depletion for regular tax and AMT:

1. Regular Tax: Depletion deductions are generally more generous under regular tax rules.
1. AMT: The AMT often limits the amount of depletion that can be deducted.   

- In other terms:

1. Regular Tax: You might be able to deduct a larger amount for depletion on your regular tax return.
1. AMT: The AMT may restrict the amount you can deduct for depletion, potentially increasing your overall tax liability.   

- Key Takeaway:

The AMT can significantly impact businesses that rely heavily on depletion deductions, potentially increasing their tax burden.
