A "de minimis" benefit is a small, infrequent benefit that is impractical to account for due to its minimal value. These benefits are excluded from income under IRC Section 132(a)(4) unless otherwise addressed in the Code. These include such items as:

- Controlled, occasional employee use of photocopier
- Occasional snacks, coffee, doughnuts, etc.
- Occasional tickets for entertainment events
- Holiday gifts
- Occasional meal money or transportation expense for working overtime
- Group-term life insurance for employee spouse or dependent with face value not more than $2,000
- Flowers, fruit, books, etc., provided under special circumstances
- Personal use of a cell phone provided by an employer primarily for business purposes

To determine if a benefit is "de minimis," consider its value and frequency. It must be occasional or infrequent and not disguised compensation. Whether something qualifies as de minimis depends on the facts and circumstances. If the benefit is too large, the entire value becomes taxable. The IRS has ruled that benefits over $100 generally don't qualify as de minimis, even in unusual cases.
