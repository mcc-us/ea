**1. IRA Types**

**Traditional IRA**: 
- Only taxed when withdrawn. 
- Contributions may be deductible or Pre-tax.
- Deductions phase out at higher income levels if covered by a workplace retirement plan.

**Roth IRA**: 
- Withdrawals are gen. tax-free, because contributions are made with after-tax income and are not deductible. Income limits apply for eligibility, but anyone can convert a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.

**Sep  IRA**: 
- Simplified-Employee-Pension plan (SEP)

**IRA Contribution Rules (2023)**
- $6,500 per individual (7,500 if age 50 or older).
- **Exceptions to Limits**:
  - Rollovers, qualified reservist repayments, and disaster/coronavirus-related distributions.
- Contributions require qualifying taxable compensation (e.g., wages, self-employment income). Certain nontaxable income (e.g., child support, rental income) does not qualify.

**Qualified Disaster & Special Distributions**
- Up to $100,000 can be withdrawn for specific disasters without penalties.
  - Income can be spread over three years, and funds can be repaid within three years.
- SECURE Act 2.0 allows penalty-free distributions for federal disasters, up to $22,000.

**Roth IRA Highlights**
- Contributions are non-deductible but offer tax-free withdrawals if rules are met.
- No required minimum distributions (RMDs).
- Contributions allowed at any age, but income limits apply for eligibility.

**Traditional IRA Distributions**
- Taxable unless exceptions apply (e.g., rollovers, charitable distributions).
- Early withdrawals (before age 59½) may incur a 10% penalty, unless specific exceptions apply (e.g., medical expenses, first-time home purchases).

**Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**
- **Traditional IRAs**:
  - Start at age 73 (age 75 from 2033 per SECURE Act 2.0).
  - Failure to take RMDs incurs penalties (25%, reduced to 10% if corrected promptly).
- **Roth IRAs**: No RMDs required.

**Spousal IRA Contributions**
- Married couples filing jointly can contribute to each spouse's IRA even if one spouse lacks qualifying compensation.

**Rollovers**
- Transfers from one retirement account to another.
- **Indirect Rollovers**:
  - Must redeposit funds within 60 days to avoid penalties.
  - 20% withholding applies for taxes (can be avoided with direct rollovers).

**Excess Contributions**
- Contributions exceeding the annual limit are subject to a 6% excise tax unless corrected by withdrawing excess contributions and earnings before the tax return due date.

**Inherited IRAs**
- Beneficiaries generally must fully distribute the account within 10 years of the original owner's death.
- Special rules apply for "Eligible Designated Beneficiaries" (e.g., surviving spouses, minor children, disabled individuals).

**Prohibited Transactions & Investments**
- **Prohibited Transactions**:
  - Using IRA funds for personal loans, property purchases, or dealings with disqualified persons (e.g., close relatives).
- **Prohibited Investments**:
  - Collectibles, life insurance contracts, and personal-use real estate.
  - Exceptions: U.S. Treasury-minted gold/silver coins and specific bullion.

**Additional Notes**
- **Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)**: Taxpayers 70½ or older can donate up to $100,000 directly from an IRA to a charity tax-free.
- **Form 1099-R**: Used to report IRA distributions over $10.
