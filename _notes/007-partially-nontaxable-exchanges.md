Basis of Assets (Unit 6) - Publication 551, page 8

A partially nontaxable exchange is when **you receive property PLUS unlike property or money.**

Ex. **NOT Like for Like Exchange**

The basis of the property you receive is the same as the basis of the property you gave up, with the following adjustments (RULES).

1. Your **New Basis** = basis MINUS any money you receive or losses.

2. **New Basis** = basis PLUS any costs you incur or gains you recognize.

3. If the other party to the exchange assumes your liabilities, treat the debt assumption as money you received in the exchange.
