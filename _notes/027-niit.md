title: Net Investment Income Tax - NIIT
---
 
 The Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) is a 3.8% tax on certain types of investment income for high-income individuals. 

 
* **What's included:** 
    * Investment income such as dividends, interest, capital gains, rental income, and royalties.


* **Who's affected:** 
    * Individuals whose Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) exceeds a certain threshold. 
    * Thresholds vary based on filing status (e.g., single, married filing jointly).


* **How it works:** 
    * You pay the 3.8% tax on the lesser of:
        * Your net investment income.
        * The amount by which your MAGI exceeds the income threshold.

**In simpler terms:**

If you have significant investment income and your income exceeds a certain level, you may owe an additional 3.8% tax on that investment income.
