title: Uniform Capitalization Rules

 Uniform Capitalization Rules (UC Rules) are a set of tax rules that govern how businesses should capitalize certain costs rather than deducting them immediately. The goal of these rules is to match expenses with the revenue they generate over multiple tax years.

To capitalize means to include certain expenses in the basis of property you produce or in your inventory costs rather than deduct them as a current expense. You recover these costs through deductions for depreciation, amortization, or cost of goods sold when you use, sell, or otherwise dispose of the property.

**Key points about UC Rules:**

* **Applicable Businesses:** Generally, businesses with average annual gross receipts of more than $25 million must follow these rules.
* **Costs Subject to Capitalization:** Costs that must be capitalized include direct and indirect costs associated with property produced or acquired for resale. This includes costs like direct materials, direct labor, and indirect costs such as rent, utilities, and administrative expenses.
* **Benefits of Capitalization:** Capitalizing costs can lead to larger deductions in future years through depreciation or amortization, which can reduce current tax liability.
* **Compliance Complexity:** The UC Rules can be complex and require careful tracking and allocation of costs.
