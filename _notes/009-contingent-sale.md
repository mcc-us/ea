A contingent payment sale is when the seller gets paid only if/when the sale occurs first.

Common Examples:

- Royalty Payments: When a seller receives royalties based on future sales or usage of their product or intellectual property.
- Performance-Based Compensation (SALES BONUSES): When a salesperson or executive receives a bonus based on meeting specific performance targets.
- Sales Commissions: Standard commission on sales.

Tax Implications:

- Income Recognition: The seller generally recognizes income as the contingency is satisfied and the payment is received.
- Basis Adjustment: The seller may need to adjust the basis of the property sold to reflect the contingent payments received.

Important: specific tax treatment for contingent payment sales can be complex and depend on various factors (including the nature of the contingency, the timing of payments, and applicable tax laws).
