A **contingent payment sale** is when the seller gets paid only **if/when the sale occurs first**. 

**Common Examples:**

* Royalty Payments: When a seller receives royalties based on future sales or usage of their product or intellectual property.
* Performance-Based Compensation(**SALES BONUSES**): When a salesperson or executive receives a bonus based on meeting specific performance targets.
* Sales Commissions: Standard commission on sales.

**Tax Implications:**

* **Income Recognition:** The seller generally recognizes income as the contingency is satisfied and the payment is received.
* **Basis Adjustment:** The seller may need to adjust the basis of the property sold to reflect the contingent payments received.

It's important to note that the specific tax treatment of contingent payment sales can be complex and depends on various factors, including the nature of the contingency, the timing of payments, and applicable tax laws. Consulting with a tax professional can help ensure accurate tax reporting for such transactions.
