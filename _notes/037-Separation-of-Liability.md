**Separation of Liability Relief** is available under the broader concept of **Innocent Spouse Relief**. 

It is designed for individuals who filed a joint tax return with a spouse (or former spouse) but wish to separate their responsibility for additional taxes due to errors on their past return. 

This relief is typically available to those who are **divorced, legally separated, widowed, or no longer living with their spouse**.

- **Key Points**:
- **Separation of Liability Relief** helps one if they are no longer married or living with the spouse they filed the joint return with. They want to limit your liability for additional taxes due to your spouse's actions.
- This relief is distinct from general **Innocent Spouse Relief**, where complete relief from liability may be available regardless of marital status if other criteria are met.

#### What is Separation of Liability?
- **Separation of Liability Relief** allows a taxpayer to divide or "separate" responsibility for additional taxes, penalties, and interest between themselves and their spouse (or former spouse) based on the income and deductions each claimed on a previously filed joint return.
- With this relief, you are responsible only for the tax attributable to the income or deductions you reported, while your spouse or former spouse remains liable for their portion.
- However, **Separation of Liability Relief does not provide refunds for taxes already paid**; it only relieves you from paying additional taxes due to your spouse's income or assets.

#### How to Request Separation of Liability Relief:
- You must file **Form 8857 (Request for Innocent Spouse Relief)** to apply for Separation of Liability Relief, provided you meet the qualifications.

- **Who Qualifies**?
You may qualify if:
1. You are **divorced or legally separated** from the spouse with whom you filed the joint return.
2. You have **not lived with your spouse** during the 12 months before filing Form 8857.
3. You are **widowed** from the spouse with whom you filed the joint return.

- **How Does Separation of Liability Work**?
- The IRS will allocate responsibility for taxes, penalties, and interest based on each spouse's individual income and deductions. This applies only to **understatements of income or incorrect deductions/credits** on a joint return.
- If approved, the IRS will assign the tax liabilities accordingly, based on your and your spouse's contributions to the income or deductions on the return.

- **Who CANNOT Qualify**?
You cannot qualify if:
- You **knew** about the items causing the understatement of tax when you signed the joint return.
- You transferred property to your spouse or ex-spouse as part of a scheme to avoid taxes.
- The IRS determines your request is part of a fraudulent scheme.

- **Differences Between Separation of Liability and Innocent Spouse Relief**:
1. **Innocent Spouse Relief** may fully relieve you from liability for unpaid taxes due to your spouse's actions. In contrast, **Separation of Liability** divides the liability based on each spouse's income and deductions.
2. **Innocent Spouse Relief** can be granted even if you are still married, whereas **Separation of Liability Relief** requires that you be divorced, legally separated, or not living together for the past year.
