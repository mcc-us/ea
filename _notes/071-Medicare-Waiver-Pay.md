**B.** Care giver can *choose* to report pay as income for possible tax credits.

**C.** Money can fund an IRA, but NO tax deduction.

1.  **What Are They & Tax Rule:**
    * Are payments received by someone (*the taxpayer/care provider*) for caring of a disabled individual **in their home**.
    * Called **"difficulty-of-care"** payments.
    * **IMPORTANTLY:** If the care provider and disabled person live in the *same home*, these payments (*generally*) **do not count as taxable income** for the care provider. 
    * The **provider can be *exclude* pay from gross income**.
    * It doesn't matter who owns the home.
    * The **care provider doesn't need to be related** to the disabled person (*they are caring for, though they often are*).
<br>
1.  **Residency is Key:**
    * Payments can be excluded from income IF & ONLY IF the care provider and the person receiving care live in the *same residence*.
    * If **different homes the payments are  taxable income**.

1.  **Option to Include for Tax Credits:**
    * Even though these payments can often be excluded from income (making them non-taxable), the person receiving them *has the choice* to **include them as income** on their tax return.
    * **Why?** Doing so might make them eligible for certain *refundable tax credits*, like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). 
    * These credits often require having a certain amount of "earned income," and excluded income typically doesn't count. By *choosing* to count the waiver payments as income, they might qualify for or increase these valuable credits.
    * This option is supported by a court case (*Feigh v. Commissioner*).

2.  **Using Payments for Retirement Savings (IRA):**
    * Thanks to the SECURE Act, individuals receiving these waiver payments can use the money to contribute to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA).
    * **However:** Because the money used for the contribution was originally *excluded* from income (non-taxable), the IRA contribution itself is considered **nondeductible**. This means you don't get an additional tax deduction for making the IRA contribution in the year you make it (though the money within a traditional IRA may grow tax-deferred).
