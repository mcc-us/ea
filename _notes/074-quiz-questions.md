1. Question ID: 94849878 (Topic: Education Credits)

Bernice is 25 and single. She enrolled in college for the fall semester. She meets all the requirements to claim the American Opportunity Credit. During the year, Bernice pays $5,000 in college tuition and $4,000 for room and board. Bernice received a $5,000 Pell grant and took out a $2,750 student loan to pay her remaining expenses. She paid the remaining $1,250 out of her own savings. She makes $15,000 in wages from a part-time job. Bernice chooses to apply the Pell grant entirely to her tuition expenses. Based on the information in this scenario, what is the amount of Bernice's American Opportunity Credit?

    A. $2,500.
    B. $0 correct
    C. $1,250.
    D. $2,750.

B:

Her credit amount will be $0. If she chooses to apply the Pell grant to the qualified education expenses, it will qualify as a tax-free scholarship. Bernice will not include any part of the Pell grant in gross income, and it will be nontaxable. After reducing qualified education expenses by the tax-free scholarship, Bernice will have $0 ($5,000 - $5,000) of adjusted qualified education expenses available to figure her American Opportunity Credit. Her credit will be $0.

6. Question ID: 94849830 (Topic: Medical, Dental, Vision, and Long-Term Care Expenses)

On January 10, 2024, Andrew paid $11,000 in medical expenses for his wife Louise, who later died on February 1, 2024. Andrew later meets and marries Bella, and they get married on December 31, 2024. Andrew and Bella will file jointly. How should the medical expenses that Andrew paid for Louise (his late wife) be treated for tax purposes? 

    A. The medical expenses paid for Louise are only deductible on Louise's final Form 1040.
    B. The medical expenses are not deductible by either spouse. 
    C. Because Andrew was married to Louise when she received the medical services, he can include those expenses in figuring his medical expense deduction for the year. correct
    D. The medical expenses are only deductible by Andrew if he files a joint return with his late wife (Louise). 

C:

Because Andrew was married to Louise when she received the medical services, he can include those expenses in figuring his medical expense deduction for the year. Andrew cannot file a joint return with his late wife because he remarried in the same year. He may file a joint return with his NEW wife, which in turn, means that Louise's final tax return must be filed as MFS. However, since Andrew was married to Louise when she incurred the medical expenses, and since he paid for the medical expenses, he is allowed to deduct them on his return, regardless of whether he files a joint return or a separate return. 

This question is based on an example in IRS Publication 502, Medical and Dental expenses.

 

11. Question ID: 94849813 (Topic: Education Credits)

What is the maximum amount of the American Opportunity Tax Credit, and what is the refundable portion of the credit?

    A. The credit is a maximum of $2,000 per return.
    B. The credit is worth $2,500 per eligible student. Up to 40% of the credit (up to $1,000) is refundable. correct
    C. The credit is worth up to $4,000 per eligible student. Up to 50% of the credit ($2,000) is refundable.
    D. $2,500 per student. The entire amount is refundable. 
    
B:

The AOTC is a tax credit of up to $2,500 of the cost of tuition, fees and course materials paid during the taxable year. Also, up to 40% of the credit (up to $1,000) is refundable. This means you can get a refund even if you owe no tax. Taxpayers will receive a tax credit based on 100 percent of the first $2,000, plus 25 percent of the next $2,000, paid during the taxable year for tuition, fees and course materials. See Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education, for information about the AOTC.

12. Question ID: 94849950 (Topic: Interest Expense)

Maria is unmarried and has one dependent son, age 18, who is a full-time student. She plans to file as Head of Household. Her AGI is $79,000. During the year, she paid the following expenses:

    $12,000 in home mortgage interest on her primary residence
    $2,200 in interest on a second home
    $2,500 in student loan interest
    $30 in late fees for paying her own home mortgage late
    $4,000 of investment interest expense. She has $5,000 of net investment income
    $600 in credit card interest, which was used for her son's college tuition

She plans to itemize her deductions. Based on these figures, what is the amount of deductible interest that she can claim on her Schedule A?

    A. $19,130
    B. $14,230
    C. $12,030
    D. $18,230correct

D:

She can deduct $18,230 in total interest on Schedule A. The answer is figured as follows:

She can deduct $14,230 in mortgage interest ($12,000 + $2,200 + $30 in late fees). She can deduct interest on up to two personal homes.
She can also deduct $4,000 in investment interest expense (she earned $5,000 of net investment income, so her deduction for interest expense is not limited).

The credit card interest is treated as personal interest and is not deductible on Schedule A. The student loan interest would be deductible, but not on Schedule A. Student loan interest is deducted as an adjustment to Income on Form 1040. For more information on deductible interest expenses, see Topic 505, Interest Expense. 

15. Question ID: 94850239 (Topic: Gift Taxes)

Draco gives his daughter, Camille, 20 shares of stock in ABC Corporation. At the time of the gift, the FMV of the shares is $900. Draco had an adjusted basis in the stock of $500 at the time of the gift. Camille sells the stock two months later for $975. What is Camille's basis in the stock, for the determination of gain?

    A. $0
    B. $900
    C. $975
    D. $500correct

D:

Camille's basis in the stock is $500. For purposes of determining gain, the taxpayer will generally take a "transferred basis" when they receive property as a gift. This means that Camille's basis in the property is the same as her father's basis in the property. This is the general rule, but there are exceptions. For example, a different rule applies if the taxpayer eventually sells the gifted property at a LOSS. If the FMV of the property at the time of the gift was LESS than the donor's adjusted basis, the basis for loss on its sale is its FMV at the time of the gift, plus or minus any required adjustments to basis during the period the original owner (the donor) held the property. In other words, for purposes of determining losses, the taxpayer must use the lesser of the donor's adjusted basis or the FMV at the time of the gift as their basis.

9. Question ID: 94816026 (Topic: Medical, Dental, Vision, and Long-Term Care Expenses)

Last year, Jacob's 22 year old niece, Mary, was his dependent. In 2024, she no longer qualifies as his dependent because she is no longer a student and she earned $6,000 in wages, so she does not meet the gross income test to be claimed as a qualifying relative. However, Jacob paid $1,800 this year for medical expenses Mary incurred last year when she was his dependent. Which of the following statements is true?

    A. Jacob cannot include his niece's medical expenses on his own tax return.
    B. Since she is not Jacob's dependent, Mary is the only one who can claim the $1,800 in medical expenses on her own return.
    C. Jacob can include the $1,800 in figuring this year's medical expense deduction on his Schedule A. correct
    D. Jacob can claim the $1,800 as an adjustment to income on his own return.

C:

Jacob can include the $1,800 in figuring this year's medical expense deduction on his Schedule A. According to IRS Publication 502, "a taxpayer can deduct medical expenses you pay for yourself, as well as those you pay for someone who was your spouse or your dependent either when the services were provided or when you paid for them." Since Mary was Jacob's dependent when the services were provided, the amounts are deductible by Jacob if he is the one who paid them. (This question is based on a prior EA exam question).

    C. May 15
    D. June 30

A:

For calendar-year estates and trusts, Form 1041 and Schedule(s) K-1 are due by April 15.

21. Question ID: 94855000 (Topic: Rental Property and Income)

Peter owns a lake cottage that he bought last year, intending to use the home as a vacation property for himself. In the current year, he rented the cottage for 10 days to a stranger, and Peter used the cottage for 20 days for his own personal use. The cottage was not used the rest of the year, and sat empty. Peter had rental income of $1,000 and he paid $450 for repairs because his renter broke a window. How should he report these activities on his tax return?

    A. $0 income, $0 expense (it does not have to be reported), correct
    B. $1,000 income, $450 expense on Schedule E
    C. $1,000 income, $450 expense on Schedule C
    D. $1,000 reported as "other income" and no rental expenses would be permitted.

A:

Peter would report $0 income, and $0 expenses (i.e., this rental activity does not have to be reported). If you rent out a personal dwelling for less than 15 days during the tax year, this is considered "Minimal Rental Use." This is a special rule that applies, if the property qualifies as a residence and is rented for less than 15 days during the year, then the rental income is not taxable, and no expenses would be deductible.

23. Question ID: 94849887 (Topic: Foreign Income and Taxes)

Which of the following foreign taxes are deductible by individual taxpayers?

    A. Foreign sales taxes.
    B. Foreign real estate taxes.
    C. Foreign property taxes. 
    D. Foreign income taxes. correct

D:

Foreign income taxes are deductible. A taxpayer can claim a credit or a deduction for foreign taxes that are imposed by a foreign country. Generally, only foreign income taxes qualify for the credit. In most cases, it is to the taxpayer’s advantage to take foreign income taxes as a tax credit, rather than a deduction, but taxpayers may choose which method gives them a better tax result.

Note: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the deduction for foreign real estate taxes. In previous years, a taxpayer was allowed to deduct foreign property taxes on Schedule A, but that deduction is no longer permissible.

24. Question ID: 94815946 (Topic: Kiddie Tax on Investment Income)

Which of the following individuals would NOT be subject to the kiddie tax in 2024?

    A. Amelia, age 19, who is a full-time college student who lives at home with her parents. She has $4,800 of investment income from dividends and interest.
    B. Matt, age 15, who has $19,500 of wages from a small role in a TV commercial. correct
    C. Ginger, who is 15 and has $3,800 in interest income and no other income for the year.
    D. Corinna, age 17, who has $5,200 of Alaska Permanent Fund dividends.

B:

Since Matt only has wages (no passive income or investment income), he would not be subject to the kiddie tax. "Active income" such as wages or self-employment income is never subject to the kiddie tax. For 2024, the first $1,300 of a child's unearned income qualifies for the standard deduction, the next $1,300 is taxed at the child's income tax rate, and unearned income above $2,600 is subject to the "kiddie tax" by being taxed at the parent's marginal income tax rate.

For more information on the Kiddie Tax, see Topic No. 553 Tax on a Child's Investment and Other Unearned Income (Kiddie Tax).

25. Question ID: 95002988 (Topic: Charitable Contributions)

    B. The donation of 10 shares of appreciated stock.
    C. Mileage costs for driving to and from her volunteer shift at the SPCA.
    D. Fair market value of the hours she spent volunteering at the charity. correct
