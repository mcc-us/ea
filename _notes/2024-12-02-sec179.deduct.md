A Section 179 deduction allows businesses to deduct the full cost of certain qualifying property, such as equipment and software, in the year of purchase, rather than depreciating it over several years. This can significantly reduce a business's taxable income in the year of purchase.

**Key points to remember:**

* **Dollar Limit:** There's a yearly dollar limit on the amount you can deduct. 
* **Phase-Out Range:** If your total purchases exceed a certain threshold, the deduction begins to phase out. 
* **Qualifying Property:** The deduction applies to a wide range of business property, including computers, vehicles, furniture, and machinery.

By taking advantage of Section 179 deductions, businesses can accelerate tax savings and invest in their operations.
