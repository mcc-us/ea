A taxable recovery is when you receive a payment or reimbursement for a loss or expense that you previously deducted on your tax return. In such cases, the IRS may require you to include the recovery in your taxable income, effectively undoing the tax benefit you received earlier.

**Common scenarios where taxable recoveries may occur:**

* **Insurance Reimbursements:** If you receive insurance reimbursement for a loss that you previously deducted, the reimbursement may be taxable.
* **Lawsuit Settlements:** If you receive a settlement or judgment for damages that you previously deducted, the recovery may be taxable.
* **Tax Refunds:** If you receive a refund for taxes you overpaid in a previous year, it may be taxable if you claimed the overpayment as a deduction in that year.
