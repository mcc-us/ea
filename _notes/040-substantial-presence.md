The Substantial Presence Test is used by the IRS to determine if a non-U.S. citizen or non-resident alien qualifies as a resident for tax purposes, based on their presence in the US.

- **An individual must have been present in the U.S. for**:

1. At least 31 days during the current calendar year, and
    - A total of 183 days during a three-year period, counting:
    - All of the days they were present in the current year, plus
    - One-third of the days they were present in the previous year, plus
    - One-sixth of the days they were present in the year before that.

- **Example**:

**The calculation to meet the Substantial Presence Test for 2023, might look like this:

- Days present in 2023: 120 days (count 120 days)
- Days present in 2022: 180 days (count 60 days, which is 1/3 of 180)
- Days present in 2021: 90 days (count 15 days, which is 1/6 of 90)

In total: 120 + 60 + 15 = 195 days.

Since this exceeds 183 days, the person would be considered a resident alien for U.S. tax purposes in 2023.

- **Exceptions**:

Certain days of presence do not count toward the test, such as:

- Days the individual is in the U.S. as a student on an F, J, M, or Q visa (with conditions).
- Days they were present as a teacher, trainee, or diplomat on certain visas.
- Days they were in the U.S. due to a medical condition that developed while in the country.
- Days of presence for less than 24 hours when traveling between foreign destinations.

Individuals who qualify under this test are generally taxed on their worldwide income, similar to U.S. citizens and permanent residents.
