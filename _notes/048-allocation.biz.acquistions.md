Q. Is this passage saying that when buying business and trade from an other vendor the business needs to subtract what was paid for each sale and allocate it toward the cost of goods for that sale?

*Trade or Business Acquired*
If you acquire a trade or business, allocate the
consideration paid to the various assets ac-
quired. Generally, reduce the consideration
paid by any cash and general deposit accounts
(including checking and savings accounts) re-
ceived. Allocate the remaining consideration to
the other business assets received in propor-
tion to (but not more than) their FMV in the fol-
lowing order.
1. Certificates of deposit, U.S. government
securities, foreign currency, and actively
traded personal property, including stock
and securities.
2. Accounts receivable, other debt instru-
ments, and assets you mark to market at
least annually for federal income tax pur-
poses.
3. Property of a kind that would properly be
included in inventory if on hand at the end
of the tax year or property held primarily
for sale to customers in the ordinary
course of business.
 All other assets except section 197 intan-
gibles, goodwill, and going concern value.
5. Section 197 intangibles except goodwill
and going concern value.
6. Goodwill and going concern value
(whether or not they qualify as section 197
intangibles).


**Understanding the Allocation of Purchase Price**

When acquiring a business, you must allocate the purchase price to the various assets acquired. This allocation is crucial for determining the basis of each asset, which, in turn, affects depreciation, amortization, and gain or loss calculations when the assets are sold or disposed of.

**Key Point:** The goal of this allocation process is to accurately value each asset acquired, ensuring proper tax treatment for future accounting and tax purposes.


**Here's a breakdown of the allocation process:**

1. **Cash and Deposits:** First, subtract any cash and general deposit accounts received from the total purchase price.
2. **High-Value Assets:** Allocate the remaining purchase price to high-value assets like certificates of deposit, government securities, and actively traded stocks and securities.
3. **Accounts Receivable and Debt Instruments:** Allocate to these assets next.
4. **Inventory and Similar Assets:** Allocate to inventory, work-in-progress, and other assets held for sale.
5. **Other Assets:** Allocate to other assets, excluding goodwill, going concern value, and section 197 intangibles.
6. **Section 197 Intangibles:** Allocate to intangible assets like patents, trademarks, and copyrights (excluding goodwill and going concern value).
7. **Goodwill and Going Concern Value:** Allocate any remaining purchase price to goodwill and going concern value, which are intangible assets representing the business's reputation, customer base, and other non-physical assets.
