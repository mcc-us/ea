title: Alimony v. Child Support
---
 
Alimony and child support are both financial payments that can be ordered by a court in a divorce, but they serve different purposes:
 

- **Alimony**

- Purpose: To provide financial support to a spouse who may have sacrificed their career or earning potential during the marriage. It aims to help them maintain a similar standard of living to what they had during the marriage.   

- Recipient: A spouse  

- Duration: Can be temporary (e.g., while a spouse gets education or training) or permanent (in some cases).  

- Tax implications: Alimony payments are no longer tax-deductible for the payer, and they are not considered taxable income for the recipient (for divorces finalized after December 31, 2018).

- **Child Support**

- Purpose: To ensure that the financial needs of children are met after a divorce. It covers expenses like food, shelter, clothing, education, and healthcare.   

- Recipient: A parent on behalf of the child(ren)

- Duration: Typically continues until the child reaches the age of majority (usually 18) or completes high school. It may be extended in some cases, such as if the child has special needs. 

- Tax implications: Child support payments are not tax-deductible for the payer, and they are not considered taxable income for the recipient.
