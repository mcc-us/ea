title: Form 982 - Bankruptcy
---
 
[Form 982](/ea/pmd/view.f982), **Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness (and Section 1082 Basis Adjustment)**, is an IRS form used by taxpayers who have had debt discharged (canceled) and are eligible to exclude that debt from their taxable income. This exclusion applies in specific situations, such as:  

- Bankruptcy: Debt discharged in a Title 11 bankruptcy case.   

- Insolvency: When liabilities exceed assets.  
  
- Farm debt.  

- Real property business debt.  

- Principal residence indebtedness: Debt secured by a primary home (with some limitations).  

- **Why is it used?**

- When debt is canceled, it's generally considered income and is taxable. However, in these specific situations, the IRS allows taxpayers to exclude the discharged debt from their income. [Form 982](/ea/pmd/view.f982) is used to:  

- Report the excluded debt amount: The taxpayer reports the amount of debt that was discharged and excluded from their income.   

- Reduce tax attributes: In exchange for excluding the debt from income, the taxpayer must reduce certain "tax attributes." These are things like net operating losses, capital losses, and the basis of assets. This reduction ensures that the taxpayer doesn't get a double benefit (not paying taxes on the forgiven debt and also keeping the full value of tax deductions related to those debts or assets).  

- **In simpler terms:**

Imagine you owe a lot of money, and a lender forgives part of that debt. Usually, that forgiven amount is considered income and you have to pay taxes on it. But, if you're in a situation like bankruptcy or if the debt was related to your farm or business, you might be able to exclude it from your income. Form 982 is how you tell the IRS about this exclusion and how you're reducing other tax benefits to make up for it.
