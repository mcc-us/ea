Have you heard advice online claiming you can deduct your haircuts as a business expense? Let’s set the record straight:

Not Actual Tax Law:
“Get a haircut and write it off as a business expense if you're self-employed since it’s ordinary and necessary to look professional.”

Actual Tax Law:

- Haircuts Are Considered Inherently Personal Expenses: The IRS doesn’t allow deductions for personal grooming, including haircuts, even if they’re necessary for work. This applies to everyone, from CEOs to influencers.

- Business Deductions Must Be Ordinary and Necessary: It’s not your opinion of what’s ordinary and necessary, it’s tax court’s opinion. And in tax court’s opinion, haircuts are a personal expense that is non-deductible under IRC 262(a), rather than an ordinary and necessary business expense under 162(a).

- Misleading Social Media Advice Can Cost You: Deducting personal expenses like haircuts can be a part of an expensive IRS audit and cause you to lose credibility.
