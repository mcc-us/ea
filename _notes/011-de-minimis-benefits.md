A "de minimis" benefit is a **small, occasional or infrequent and that is not disguised compensation benefit that is impractical to account for due to its small value**. De minimis benefits are excluded from taxpayer income (under IRC Section 132(a)(4)) unless otherwise addressed in the Code.

### How to determine a "de minimis" benefit. 

1. The IRS has ruled that **benefits over $100 generally don't qualify as de minimis benefits even in unusual cases.**
2. It must be small, occasional or infrequent. 
3. The benefit may NOT be a 'disguised compensation.'
3. Whether something qualifies as de minimis may depend on the facts and circumstances. 

 De minimis examples:

- **Group-term life insurance for employee spouse or dependent with face value not more than $2,000**
- Controlled, occasional employee use of photocopier
- Occasional snacks, coffee, doughnuts, etc.
- Occasional tickets for entertainment events
- Holiday gifts
- Occasional meal money or transportation expense for working overtime
- Flowers, fruit, books, etc., provided under special circumstances
- Personal use of a cell phone provided by an employer primarily for business purposes
