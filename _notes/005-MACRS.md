- **Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System** is a depreciation method.

- **Key Points to Remember:**
- MACRS allows for accelerated depreciation
- Businesses can deduct a larger portion of an asset's cost earlier. 
- Assets are classified into different property classes (e.g., 5-year, 7-year, 27.5 yr, 39 yr) with specific depreciation schedules.
- MACRS rules can be complex.

  1. **Current Assets** such as:
     * Cash & cash equivalents
     * Accounts receivable
     * Inventory
     * Short-term investments
     * Prepaid expenses
  2. **Long-Term Assets** including:
     * *Property, plant, and equipment* (PP&E): *Land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles*.
     * *Intangible assets*: Patents, trademarks, copyrights, goodwill, etc.
     * *Long-term investments*: Stocks, bonds, and other investments held for more than a year.


**Relevance to Individual Taxpayers:**

While MACRS is primarily used by businesses, it can indirectly affect individual taxpayers in a few ways:

1. **Rental Property:** If you own rental property, you can use MACRS to depreciate the building and other assets associated with the property. This can reduce your taxable income from the rental property.
2. **Business Income:** If you own a business, you'll likely use MACRS to calculate depreciation on your business assets. This can impact your business income and, in turn, your individual tax return.
