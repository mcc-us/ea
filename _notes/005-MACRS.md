**Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System** is a depreciation method.

**Key Points to Remember:**
- Accelerated depreciation,
- Businesses can deduct a larger portion of an asset's cost earlier, 
- Assets are classified and have specific depreciation schedules,
- MACRS rules can be complex.

**Relevance to Individual Taxpayers:**

While MACRS is primarily used by businesses, it can indirectly affect individual taxpayers in a few ways:

1. **Rental Property:** If you own rental property, you can use MACRS to depreciate the building and other assets associated with the property. This can reduce your taxable income from the rental property, e.g. **residential=27.5 yr**
2. **Business Income:** If you own a business, you'll likely use MACRS to calculate depreciation on your business assets. This can impact your business income and, in turn, your individual tax return, e.g. business bldg=39 yr


  1. **Current Assets** such as:
     * Cash & cash equivalents
     * Accounts receivable
     * Inventory
     * Short-term investments
     * Prepaid expenses
  2. **Long-Term Assets** including:
     * *Property, plant, and equipment* (PP&E): *Land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles*.
     * *Intangible assets*: Patents, trademarks, copyrights, goodwill, etc.
     * *Long-term investments*: Stocks, bonds, and other investments held for more than a year.
