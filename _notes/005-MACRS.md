**Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System** is a depreciation method thqt allows you can deduct a larger portion of the cost in the earlier years of the asset's life. 

**How it Works:**

* **Assets are Classified** e.g. as 5-year, 7-year, or 27.5-year property.

    1. **Current Assets** such as:
    * Cash & cash equivalents
    * Accounts receivable
    * Inventory
    * Short-term investments
    * Prepaid expenses
    2. **Long-Term Assets** including:
    * Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E): Land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, etc.
    * Intangible assets: Patents, trademarks, copyrights, goodwill, etc.
    * Long-term investments: Stocks, bonds, and other investments held for more than a year.

* **Depreciation Schedule:** Each class has a specific depreciation schedule that determines how much of the asset's cost can be deducted each year.
* **Accelerated Depreciation:** MACRS allows for accelerated depreciation, meaning you can deduct a larger portion of the cost in the earlier years of the asset's life. 

**Relevance to Individual Taxpayers:**

While MACRS is primarily used by businesses, it can indirectly affect individual taxpayers in a few ways:

1. **Rental Property:** If you own rental property, you can use MACRS to depreciate the building and other assets associated with the property. This can reduce your taxable income from the rental property.
2. **Business Income:** If you own a business, you'll likely use MACRS to calculate depreciation on your business assets. This can impact your business income and, in turn, your individual tax return.

**Key Points to Remember:**

* MACRS can be complex, and understanding the specific rules and regulations for different property classes is important.
* Consulting with a tax professional can help ensure that you're taking advantage of all available depreciation deductions.
* Changes in tax laws can impact MACRS, so it's essential to stay updated on the latest rules.

By understanding MACRS, you can optimize your tax deductions and minimize your tax liability.
