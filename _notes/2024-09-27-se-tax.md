Q. Explain self-employment taxes.

Self-Employment Taxes are paid by individuals who work for themselves. The SE tax pays Social Security and Medicare taxes that are withheld from employees' paychecks.

Here's a breakdown of the two components:

Total = 15.3% = (12.4 + 2.9) **for Self-Employed**

1. Social Security Tax: This portion is calculated at a rate of **12.4%** `(6.2% + 6.2%)` of your net earnings. However, you only pay half of this rate (6.2%) as a self-employed individual. The other half is considered an expense that can be deducted from your taxable income.
2. Medicare Tax: This portion is calculated at a rate of **2.9%** `(1.45% + 1.45%)` of your net earnings. Similar to Social Security tax, you only pay half of this rate (1.45%) as a self-employed individual. The remaining 1.45% is considered an expense that can be deducted from your taxable income.

- If your net earnings exceed a $200,000 as individuals or $250,000 as married couples (this changes annually), you'll need to pay an additional 0.9% Medicare tax.  

- The Additional Medicare Tax of 0.9% tax started in 2013 as a part of the Affordable Care Act, it helps fund care for individuals with low incomes.
