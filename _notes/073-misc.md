* Kiddie Tax
The following two situations may affect the tax and reporting of the unearned income of certain children.

    If your child's interest, dividends, and other unearned income total more than $2,600, it may be subject to a specific tax on the unearned income of certain children. See the Instructions for Form 8615, Tax for Certain Children Who Have Unearned Income for more information.
    If your child's only income is interest and dividend income (including capital gain distributions) and totals less than $13,000, you may be able to elect to include that income on your return rather than file a return for your child. See Form 8814, Parents' Election To Report Child's Interest and Dividends.
