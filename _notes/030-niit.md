title: Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)
---
 

The Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) is a 3.8% tax on certain types of investment income for high-income individuals.

1. Who's affected: People whose income exceeds a certain threshold.

2. What's taxed: Investment income like dividends, interest, capital gains, and rental income.

3. How it works: You pay the 3.8% tax on the lesser of your net investment income or the amount by which your income exceeds the threshold.

In essence, if you have significant investment income and your income is above a certain level, you may owe an additional 3.8% tax on that income.
