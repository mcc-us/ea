> Example. A taxable private foundation had an income tax liability for 2002 of $10,000.  If the foundation were tax exempt, it would have a $4,000 liability for tax on net investment income and a $7,000 liability for tax on unrelated busi­ness income. The foundation is liable under sec­tion 4940 for $1,000, the amount by which the sum of the tax on net investment income and the tax on unrelated business income ($11,000) ex­ceeds the amount of income tax liability ($10,000).
