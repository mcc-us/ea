### Objective
- **1**: Understand how estate and gift taxes affect individual taxpayers, especially surviving spouses and other beneficiaries.  
- **2**: Focus on the income tax treatment of estates and trusts as legal entities.   Overlap may occur, so estate taxation is covered from multiple perspectives.

## The Gift Tax

### Key Points
- **Definition**: The gift tax is not an income tax.   It applies to property transfers by one individual to another, regardless of the donor's intent.  
- **Relation to Estate Tax**: Gift and estate taxes share the same lifetime exemption amount.  
  - **Gift Tax**: Applies to transfers made during a person’s life.  
  - **Estate Tax**: Applies to transfers of property after death.  
- **Tax Liability**: The donor is responsible for paying the gift tax, not the recipient.   Recipients generally do not owe taxes or need to report gifts unless they are from a foreign donor.

## Basic Exclusion

- **Combined Exclusion**: The estate and gift tax share a combined basic exclusion amount.   Using this exclusion for gift tax during life reduces the exclusion available for estate tax after death.  
- **2023 Limits**:
  - Lifetime exemption: **$12.92 million per decedent**, indexed for inflation through 2025.  
  - Annual gift exclusion: **$17,000 per recipient**.  
  - Maximum tax rate: **40%**.  
- **Reporting**: Gifts exceeding the annual exclusion must be reported on **Form 709**, the U.S. Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return.

## Filing Form 709: Gift Tax Return

- **General Due Date**: April 15 of the following year.  
- **Special Cases**:
  - If the donor dies during the year, the filing deadline may align with the estate tax return due date.  
  - Taxpayers who file **Form 4868** (six-month extension for Form 1040) automatically extend the gift tax return if no gift tax is due.  
  - Taxpayers without a Form 1040 extension can extend the gift tax return separately using **Form 8892**.

## Filing Requirements for Gifts

A **Form 709** filing is required if:  
1. A gift exceeds the annual exclusion amount (except for a U.S. spouse).    
2. Gifts are "split" with a spouse.  
3. A "future interest" gift is made to someone other than a U.S. citizen spouse.

## Gift Types

### Present vs. Future Interest
- **Present Interest**: The donee has immediate rights to use and enjoy the property or income without restrictions.  
- **Future Interest**: The donee's rights begin at a future date, often after the donor’s death. These gifts cannot use the annual exclusion.  

### Gift Splitting
- **Concept**: A gift can be treated as equally shared by both spouses, requiring consent from both.  
- **Community Property**: Gifts from community property funds are automatically considered 50% from each spouse.  

### Non-Reportable Gifts
The following gifts are exempt from reporting and taxation:  
1. Gifts within the annual exclusion amount (**$17,000** in 2023).  
2. Tuition or medical expenses paid directly to institutions.  
3. Unlimited gifts to a U.S. citizen spouse.  
4. Gifts to political organizations.  
5. Gifts to qualifying charities.  
6. Parental support for minor children (e.g., as part of legal obligations like divorce decrees).

## Lifetime Exemption

- **Aggregate Lifetime Exemption**: Each taxpayer has a lifetime exemption (**$12.92 million in 2023**) before any out-of-pocket gift tax is due.  
- **Unified Credit**: Combines the lifetime gift and estate tax exclusions.  
  - Using the unified credit to avoid gift taxes reduces the amount available for estate taxes in the future.  
  - For gifts exceeding the annual exclusion, taxpayers can either:  
    1. Pay the gift tax on the excess.  
    2. Use the unified credit to offset the tax.
