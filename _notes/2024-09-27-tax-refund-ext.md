Sometimes, **a late-filed tax return and claiming a tax refund beyond the deadline will be honored**. The IRS will consider reasons with a reasonable cause for failing to file a tax return, or make a deposit, or pay tax when due. Including:

- Fire, casualty, natural disaster or other disturbances
- Inability to obtain records due to natural disasters, etc.
- Death, serious illness, incapacitation, or unavoidable absence of the taxpayer or a member of the taxpayer's immediate family

Several unique scenarios allow a taxpayer to request a refund beyond the normal deadline. These unique scenarios involve:

- A bad debt from worthless securities (up to seven years prior)
- A payment or accrual of foreign tax (up to ten years prior)
- A net operating loss, carryback
- A carryback of certain tax credits
- Exceptions for military personnel
- Taxpayers in federally declared disaster areas
- Taxpayers who have been affected by a terroristic or military action
