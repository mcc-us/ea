A **Coverdell** education savings account (Coverdell ESA) is a trust or custodial account set up for paying  education expenses for a designated beneficiary. 

- This benefit applies to higher education expenses, but also elementary & secondary education expenses. 
- When the account is established, the designated beneficiary must be under the age of 18 or be a special needs beneficiary.
- The document creating and governing the account must be in writing, and it must meet certain requirements.
- Total contributions to (all) accounts can't exceed $2,000 / year.

Contributions

- Any individual whose modified adjusted gross income is under a threshold for a given tax year can make contributions. 
- Corporations and trusts can contribute regardless of their adjusted gross income. Contributors must contribute by the due date of their tax return (not including extensions). 
- There's no limit to the number of accounts that can be established for a particular beneficiary; total contribution to all accounts on behalf of ONE beneficiary in any year can't exceed $2,000.
Distributions

Additionally, the beneficiary of a Coverdell ESA can receive tax-free distributions to pay education expenses. Amounts remaining in the account must be distributed within 30 days after the designated beneficiary reaches age 30, unless the beneficiary is a special needs beneficiary. If the beneficiary dies before attaining the age of 30, amounts remaining in the account must be distributed within 30 days after the date of death. Certain transfers to members of the beneficiary's family are permitted.
