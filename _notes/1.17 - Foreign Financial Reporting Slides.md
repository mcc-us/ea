## Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)
- The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), passed in 1970, requires U.S. taxpayers to report foreign financial accounts.
- It was the first U.S. law to combat money laundering.
- The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) mandates reporting of foreign financial assets.
- Foreign financial reporting is complex; the IRS continues to provide guidance.

## Reporting Forms
- Reporting obligations exist even if accounts generate no taxable income or if the taxpayer does not have a U.S. tax filing requirement.
- A "United States person" includes U.S. citizens, nationals, residents, entities, and nonresident aliens electing to file jointly with U.S. spouses.  

#### Common reporting forms:
1. **FBAR** (Form 114): Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts Report.
2. **Form 8938**: Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets.
3. **Schedule B** (Part III): Interest and Ordinary Dividends.
4. **Form 3520**: Annual Return to Report Transactions with Foreign Trusts and Gifts.
5. **Form 5471**: Information Return of U.S. Persons with Respect to Foreign Corporations.

### F114 - FBAR, Report foreign financial accounts
- **Filing Threshold**: Required if foreign accounts > $10,000 at any time.
- **Key Notes**:
  - Filed with **FinCEN**, not the IRS.
  - Records must be kept for 5 years.
  - Includes minor children.
  - Due April 15, with an automatic extension to October 15.

- **Penalties**:
  - Non-willful violations: Civil penalties up to $10,000 per FBAR report (as of February 2023).
  - Willful violations: Penalties up to $100,000 or 50% of account value, with potential criminal charges.

## Foreign Gifts and Bequests
- Report large foreign gifts/bequests using **Form 3520** if exceeding:
  - $100,000 from a nonresident alien/foreign estate.

> Note: Tuition or medical payments directly made by a foreign person are not considered "gifts."

## F8938 - Specified Foreign Financial Assets
- Filing required if asset values exceed these thresholds:
  - **Living in the U.S.**:
    - Single/MFS: $50,000 (end of year) or 75,000 (anytime).

## Other Considerations
- **Schedule B** (Part III): Used for disclosure of foreign accounts and trusts, even if FBAR is not required.
- **Form 5471**: For U.S. taxpayers owning more than 10% of a foreign corporation. Penalties for non-filing are $10,000 per failure.
