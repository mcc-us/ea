6. Question ID: 94816041 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)

Larry has been divorced from his wife, Angela, for several years. Angela has primary physical custody of their son, according to their final court decree. Angela did not provide any support for their son, because Larry was providing alimony and child support to Angela. The son lived with Angela all year long, but Angela released her right to claim the child as a dependent to Larry. What is Larry's filling status in this scenario?

A. Singlecorrect
B. Married filing jointly
C. Head of Household  
D. Married filing separate

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Using the Form 8332, Angela can release the dependency exemption to Larry. Then the father could claim the child as the noncustodial parent. But he cannot file as head of household, because the child did not live with him. So he would claim single and also claim his son as a dependent.

Note: If a custodial parent releases a claim to exemption for a child, the noncustodial parent may claim the child as a dependent and as a qualifying child for the child tax credit or credit for other dependents. However, the noncustodial parent may not claim the child for the purpose of claiming head of household filing status, the earned income credit, the credit for child and dependent care expenses. See IRS FAQ on this topic here. 

9. Question ID: 94815912 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)

Which of the following would not meet the "relationship test” to be considered a dependent?

A. Cousin.correct
B. Foster child.  
C. Father-in-law.
D. Step-daughter.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

For the relationship test, “family members” do not include cousins, who are treated as unrelated persons. A cousin must live with the taxpayer for the entire year and also meet the gross income test in order to qualify as a dependent. A family member who is related to the taxpayer in any of the following ways does not have to live with the taxpayer to meet the relationship test to be a qualifying relative:

A child, stepchild, foster child, or descendant of any of them (for example, a grandchild).
A sibling, step-sibling, or half-sibling.
A parent, grandparent, stepparent, or other direct ancestor (but not a foster parent).
A niece or nephew, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law.

Any relationship that was established by marriage is not ended by death or divorce. An adopted child is treated the same as a natural child for the purposes of the relationships described above. For example, an adopted brother or sister is a brother or sister of the taxpayer. An adopted child includes a child who was lawfully placed with a person for legal adoption.

Jeong and Rochelle had a child who was born on December 2, 2023. The child only lived for a few hours and died before midnight. Which of the following statements is correct?

A. They cannot claim the child as a dependent on their tax return, because the child did not live with them for more than half the tax year.
B. They cannot claim the child as a dependent on their tax return unless they obtain a Social Security number for the child.
C. They can claim the child as a qualifying child on their tax return, even if they are unable to obtain a Social Security number for the child.correct
D. They cannot claim the child as a dependent on their tax return in the year of birth, but they can do so for the following year, if the child is issued an SSN.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

They can claim the child as a qualifying child on their tax return, even if they are unable to obtain a Social Security number for the child. If a child is born and dies in the same tax year, a Social Security number is not required in order to claim the dependency exemption in that tax year. The tax return must be filed on paper and the taxpayer must enter the word “DIED” in the space normally reserved for the SSN. The rules regarding how to claim an exemption for a deceased child are in Publication 17.

**Question ID: 94850111 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Cecily is in the process of adopting an infant boy. She qualifies to claim the child as a dependent, but she cannot obtain a Social Security number for him yet. If you were preparing Cecily’s income tax return, what would you advise her to do?

A. Not claim the child until the adoption is final.
B. Apply for an ATIN in order to claim the child.   
C. File a tax return on paper and write “adopted” in the line for the SSN.
D. Wait until a valid Social Security number is issued in order to claim the child.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Cecily can request an ATIN and claim the child. An ATIN is an adoption taxpayer identification number, issued by the IRS as a temporary taxpayer identification number for the child in a domestic adoption when a taxpayer is unable to obtain the child’s Social Security number. An adopting taxpayer can use the ATIN on her tax return to identify the child while final domestic adoption is pending.

A. A long illness that results in long-term hospitalization.
B. A year-long sabbatical outside the country.  
C. A dependent child who is away at college all year.

Military service.

It must be reasonable to assume that the absent person will return to the home after the temporary absence. This information is found in the Filing Status chapter of IRS Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax.

**Question ID: 94816024 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Melanie is 65 and unmarried. Melanie works full time and earned $56,000 in wages during the year. Melanie lives with her cousin, Anna, who is 45 and a widow. Anna is unemployed and lived with Melanie all year. Anna received all of her support from Melanie. Based on these facts, which of the answers below best describes Melanie's filing status and tax filing obligations?

A. Melanie can file "Head of Household". She can claim Anna as her qualifying child.
B. Melanie must file "Single". She can claim Anna as her qualifying child.
C. Melanie can file "Head of Household". She can claim Anna as her qualifying relative and claim EITC.
D. Melanie must file "Single". She can claim Anna as her qualifying relative.    

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Melanie must file Single. She can claim Anna as her qualifying relative. Anna is not a qualifying person for Head of Household filing status because she is not related to Melanie in one of the ways listed on the chart in Publication 17 (i.e. "cousins" are not considered related persons for tax purposes). Therefore, Anna is Melanie's "qualifying relative" dependent only because she lived with Melanie all year as a member of her household. (Question modified from an example in Publication 4491). See the IRS chart: Who Is a Qualifying Person Qualifying You To File as Head of Household?

**Question ID: 94816036 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Matthew is 32 years old and works full time. Matthew's 19-year old cousin, Bruno, lived with him all year. Bruno did not work, and had no taxable income. Bruno's parents are deceased, and no one else can claim him as a dependent. Matthew supported his cousin completely. Would Bruno meet the tests to be Matthew's Qualifying Relative?

A. Bruno must be a full-time student in order to be claimed as a dependent
B. Bruno cannot be claimed by anyone because he is a legal adult
C. No, because cousins are not considered "family members" for the purpose of this rule.
D. Bruno would meet the tests to be Matthew's Qualifying Relative.  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Bruno would meet the tests to be Matthew's Qualifying Relative. Although cousins are not considered "family members" for the relationship test for qualifying relatives, the question stated that Bruno lived with Matthew all year. This means that Bruno meets the "Member of Household or Relationship Test" to be Matthew's Qualifying Relative. Although Matthew can claim Bruno as a dependent, he cannot file as Head of Household, because a cousin is not a qualifying relationship for HOH status.

*While Bruno qualifies as Matthew's Qualifying Relative by living with him all year, Matthew cannot file as Head of Household. This is because cousins do not meet the specific relationship requirements for Head of Household status.*
