Paul is a full-time employee of Carpet Warehouse. Paul frequently travels to meet with customers. Paul's employer gives him $500 a month ($6,000 for the year) for his business expenses. Paul does not have to provide any proof of his expenses to his employer and he can keep any funds that he does not spend. His actual expenses for the year were $1,000 for lodging, $600 for meals while away from home, and $2,000 for entertainment, when he took 5 of his best vendors out to a baseball game. What reporting is required of Paul's employer and what reporting is required of Paul?

A. Employer adds $6,000 to wages reported on Paul's Form W-2; Paul can report $3,600 as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A.  
B. Employer adds $6,000 to wages reported on Paul's Form W-2; Paul can report $1,600 as an adjustment to income.   
C. Employer adds $6,000 to wages reported on Paul's Form W-2; Paul cannot deduct the expenses on his tax return.  
D. Employer adds $6,000 to wages reported on Paul's Form W-2; Paul can report $1,600 as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A.  

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

This is a nonaccountable plan. Since Paul does not have to submit any receipts or substantiation to his employer, this means that the employer must add $6,000 to wages reported on Paul's Form W-2. Paul cannot deduct the expenses on his tax return. 

Note: Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, employee business expenses can be deducted as an adjustment to income only for specific employment categories. Armed Forces reservists, qualified performing artists, fee-basis state or local government officials, and individuals with disabilities may still deduct employee expenses on Form 2106.

Question ID: 94849661 (Topic: Fringe Benefits)

Annabelle was offered a consulting position in another state. Her new employer reimbursed her for $5,500 for her moving truck and expenses incurred during the move. How should this reimbursement be treated?

A. Because this is a reimbursement of a nondeductible expense, it is treated as wages and must be included on Annabelle’s Form W-2.  
B. The reimbursement is tax-exempt because it is a qualified moving expense.  
C. The amounts are non-taxable to Annabelle.  
D. The expense is nontaxable as long as Annabelle’s employer makes the payment directly to the moving company.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act suspended the qualified moving expense exclusion and employee deduction for moving expenses. Because this is a reimbursement of a nondeductible expense, it is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan and must be included as compensation on Annabelle’s Form W-2. An employer can still reimburse an employee for their moving expenses, but the amounts are fully taxable as wages. The employer can then deduct the expense (as wages) but the full amount will be subject to payroll taxes as well as income tax for Annabelle.

Note: There is an exception for active-duty members of the armed forces, who still are entitled to claim a deduction for moving expenses. Active-duty military can also receive non-taxable reimbursement for their qualified moving expenses.
