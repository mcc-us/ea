Therefore, the taxpayer is considered unmarried even if she filed joint returns for earlier years. The taxpayer must file amended tax returns claiming single or HOH status (if applicable) for each tax year affected by the annulment that is not closed by the statute of limitations for filing a tax return. The statute of limitations generally does not end until three years after the original return was filed.
