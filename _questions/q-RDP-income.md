### Question: How do registered domestic partners figure out their gross income for tax purposes?

### Answer:
When two people are in a registered domestic partnership, they live in a state where specific rules apply to how they share income. Specifically, for tax purposes, they need to:
1. **Share the money** they both earn as a couple equally. This means that each partner reports **half** of the total money they both made together, even if one partner earned more than the other.
2. If one partner earns **extra money on their own** (separate from what they share, like from a personal business or separate investments), that partner must also report that **individual income** in addition to their combined income.

### Example:
- Partner A makes $60,000 a year from a job.
- Partner B makes $40,000 a year from a different job.

Together, they earned \$100,000. For tax purposes, **each partner reports $50,000** (half of \$100,000), even though their actual earnings differed.

If Partner A also made an extra \$10,000 from a personal business, they would report \$50,000 (half of the combined income) **plus** the \$10,000 from the personal business, making their total reported income \$60,000.

This rule comes from community property laws in certain states, which treat the income of both partners as something to be shared equally for tax purposes.
