Let's simplify this question and answer step by step:

### Question: Can a registered domestic partner be considered a dependent of their partner when it comes to excluding medical expense reimbursements from taxes (under section 105(b))?

### Answer (in simple terms):
Yes, a registered domestic partner (let's call them **Partner A**) can be treated as a dependent for tax purposes regarding **medical expense reimbursements**. This means **Partner B** can get tax-free reimbursements for medical expenses paid for **Partner A, only if certain conditions are met**.

The key condition is that **Partner B** must provide enough financial support to **Partner A** (called the "support requirement"). This rule is similar to how you qualify someone as a dependent on your taxes, but there's an important difference:
- Normally, for someone to be your dependent under tax rules, their **income must be below a certain amount**.
- However, under **section 105(b)** (which deals with medical expense reimbursements), **Partner A's income doesn't matter**. As long as **Partner B** meets the support requirement, Partner A can still be considered a dependent for this specific purpose.

### Example:
If **Partner B** provides most of the financial support for **Partner A**, then **Partner A** can be considered a dependent. This means that **Partner B** can get tax-free reimbursements for **Partner A's** medical expenses, even if **Partner A** ***earns a good amount(?) of money***. The income limit normally applies(?) for dependents under other tax rules but does not apply here.

*Q. The phrase "earns a good amount of money" is used in the last paragraph. What does this mean exactly?*

The phrase "earns a good amount of money" in this context refers to **any income that might typically be too high** for someone to qualify as a dependent under other tax rules. Specifically, under the usual rules for claiming someone as a dependent (under section 152(d), for example), the dependent's income has to be **below a certain threshold** (called the "exemption amount"). If their income is too high, they generally **cannot be claimed as a dependent**.

However, regarding **section 105(b)** (which deals with tax-free medical reimbursements), this **income limit doesn't apply**. So, even if **Partner A** earns **more than that usual threshold**, they can still be considered a dependent for purposes of medical expense reimbursements, as long as **Partner B** meets the **support requirement**.

In short, **"earns a good amount of money"** here means **" earns more than the normal dependent income limit"**, but that doesn't stop them from qualifying as a dependent for medical reimbursements under section 105(b).
