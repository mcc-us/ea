B. Employees have more control over their work, while independent contractors follow specific instructions.
C. Employees have payroll taxes withheld by their employers, while independent contractors do not.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

In general, an employer must withhold and remit income taxes, Social Security and Medicare taxes (payroll taxes), and pay unemployment tax on salaries and wages paid to an employee. Employees have taxes withheld by their employers, while independent contractors are responsible for their own tax payments. A business generally does not have to withhold or pay taxes on payments to independent contractors, because the earnings of a person working as an independent contractor are subject to self-employment tax, which the independent contractor must calculate and report on Schedule SE (Form 1040).
