title: Q - HOH w/ Qualifying Relative
layout: post
---

Example:

William, unmarried, earns \$60,000. His 22-year-old cousin, Jimmy, lives with him. Jimmy attends college and earns $3,100.

#### Why can't William file as Head of Household (HOH)?

- HOH requires a qualifying person (child, stepchild, parent, etc.).
- Cousins are not qualifying persons for HOH.

But, why can William claim Jimmy as a qualifying relative?

- Jimmy is not William's qualifying child.
- Jimmy lived with William all year.
- Jimmy's income (\$3,100) is **below the exemption amount, $4700**.
- William likely provided more than half of Jimmy's support.

#### Steps for William:

- Confirm support: Ensure he provided over 50% of Jimmy's support.
- File as Single: William cannot file as HOH.
- Claim Jimmy as a dependent: Benefit from dependent exemption or credits.

#### Conclusion:

- William cannot file as HOH due to Jimmy's relationship.
- However, he can claim Jimmy as a qualifying relative, potentially reducing his tax liability.
