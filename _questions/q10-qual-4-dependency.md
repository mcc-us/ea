Gerry is age 62 and unmarried. He has no children, but he has several relatives living with him. All of the people listed below lived with Gerry all year long, and did not provide more than one-half of their own financial support. Which of them can be claimed by Gerry as a "qualifying relative" dependent on his tax return?

A. Douglas, his 85-year-old father, who took a $3,900 distribution from his 401(k), and also had $3,100 in capital gains. wrong
B. Shawn, his cousin, who is 26 years old and earned $4,300 from a part-time job. Shawn is not a student. correct
C. Alex, his nephew, who is age 20 and not a student. Alex did not work, but won $4,900 on a slot machine at a local casino. 
D. Karina, his 83-year-old mother, who took a $16,900 distribution from her traditional IRA. 

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Only Shawn, his cousin, could be claimed as a qualifying relative. This is because all of the other people listed have income over the "deemed exemption" amount. Shawn earned $4,300 from a part-time job, which is under the gross income limit for qualifying relatives. A qualifying relative dependent must have made less than $4,700 in gross income during 2023.

Note: Alex, his nephew, does not qualify to be claimed as a "qualifying child" because he does not meet the age test. To meet the qualifying child test, a child must be younger than 19 years old or be a "student" younger than 24 years old as of the end of the calendar year. Since Alex is 20 and not a student, then he can only be claimed as a qualifying relative dependent. And since he made more than the deemed exemption amount, he cannot be claimed at all. Learn more about the rules for dependency in Publication 929, Tax Rules for Children and Dependents.

**Question ID: 94816042 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

With regards to a child of divorced or separated parents, how does the IRS define the "custodial parent"?

A. The custodial parent is the parent who pays for the majority of the household costs for the home in which the dependent lives.
B. The custodial parent is the parent who has physical custody of the child for the greater portion of the calendar year.correct
C. The custodial parent is the parent who supports the child financially.
D. The custodial parent is the parent who is listed on the court documents with primary custody.wrong

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

The IRS defines a "custodial parent" as the parent who has physical custody of the child for the greater portion of the calendar year. However, the child will be treated as the dependent of the noncustodial parent if the custodial parent releases a claim to exemption for a child using Form 8332.

**Question ID: 94816018 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

All the following qualify as a dependent except:

A. Your 23 year-old daughter who is not a student and earned $4,800. She lived with you all year and you provided more than half of her total support.correct
B. Your deceased wifeâ€™s mother, who is 65 and lived with you for 11 months during the tax year. She had no income and filed no tax return. You provided more than half of her total support.
C. Your 18 year old son who filed a joint return with his wife to receive a refund of all his withholding. No tax liability would have been due even if they had filed separate returns. All other exemption tests are met.wrong
D. Your 18 year-old niece who is a resident of Mexico but lived with you for 10 months. She earned $500 during the summer and you provided more than half of her total support.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

A 23 year-old daughter who is NOT a student and earned $4,800 cannot be a dependent (unless she is disabled), because she does not meet the age test and she earned more than the deemed exemption amount for qualifying relatives (if the dependent is being claimed under the qualifying relative rules, the dependent's gross income must be less than $4,700 for the year). (This question is based on a prior year exam question)

**Question ID: 94815825 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Corban is divorced from his former wife, Sabine. They have a 5-year-old daughter together, named Lucie.

D. Corban can claim Lucie as a dependent if his former wife agrees and signs Form 8332. correct

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Corban can claim Lucie as a dependent if his former wife agrees and signs Form 8332. Corban is the noncustodial parent, and Sabine is the custodial parent. The Form 8332 allows the custodial parent (Sabine) to sign away the right to claim dependent children for the current year and future years, if they wish. For more information about the special rules that apply to divorced and separated parents, see Publication 504, Divorced or Separated Individuals.

**Question ID: 94815831 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Mandy and Kenneth are divorced. They share custody of two minor children. Mandy is the custodial parent and the children live with her most of the year. Mandy will allow Kenneth to claim both children this year, as part of their divorce agreement. If Mandy allows Kenneth to claim the dependency exemption, what form needs to be completed by Mandy?

A. Form 8863 must be completed by Mandy and attached to Kenneth's return.
B. Form 1098-T must be completed by Mandy and attached to Kenneth's return.
C. Form 8332 must be completed by Mandy and attached to Kenneth's return.correct
D. Form 8832 must be completed by Kenneth and attached to Mandy's return.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Form 8332 must be completed by Mandy and attached to Kenneth's return, because Kenneth is the non-custodial parent and Mandy is releasing the exemption to him. Form 8332, Release/Revocation of Release of Claim to Exemption for Child by Custodial Parent, must be filled out and attached to the return. Attaching the divorce decree is not sufficient.

**Question ID: 94815917 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Lola and Ramirus, a married couple, have financially supported Lola's elderly mother, Viola, for many years. They claim Viola as their dependent parent on their jointly filed return. On January 3, 2023, Lola dies (the wife) and Ramirus becomes a widower. Ramirus remarries before the end of the tax year, but continues to financially support his former mother-in-law, Viola, who does not live with him. Can Ramirus continue to claim Viola as a dependent on his tax return when he files jointly with his new wife?

A. No, he cannot claim Viola as his dependent because they are no longer related by marriage.
B. No, he cannot claim Viola as his dependent unless they live in the same household.
C. Yes, he can claim Viola as his dependent on his joint return.correct
D. None of the answers are correct.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Since Ramirus has continued to support Viola, he can claim her as his dependent on the joint return, even though he has remarried. Any dependency relationships established by marriage do not end as a result of death or divorce (for tax purposes). For example, if a taxpayer supports a mother-in-law, he can continue to claim her as a dependent even if he and his ex-spouse are divorced or if he becomes widowed at a later date. 

Note: Treasury Regulations section 1.152-2(d) currently provides that "the relationship if affinity once existing will not terminate by divorce or death of spouse." So the mother-in-law would still be considered "related" to the taxpayer for IRS purposes.

**Question ID: 94815827 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Calista is 16 years old and she has a reputation for being the best babysitter in town. She earns $14,320 by babysitting for family and friends during the tax year, but none of her clients file a 1099-NEC reporting her income. Her parents claim Calista as a dependent and she does not provide more than one half of her own financial support. What is true about Calista's tax situation?

A. Calista is required to file a tax return to report her income and can deduct business expenses relating to babysitting.correct
B. Since Calista did not receive any 1099 forms, she is not required to file a tax return or report her income.
C. Since Calista is under 18, she does not need to file a tax return or report her income.
D. Calista is required to file a tax return to report her income, but she will be exempt from self-employment tax.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Even though she is under 18, the amount of income Calista made exceeds the limit for filing a return. She is required to file a Form 1040, even if she is claimed by her parents. If Calista pursues this babysitting activity with a bona-fide "intent to make a profit", then she is considered self-employed, and her business income would be reported on Schedule C. Calista may also deduct any business expenses relating to her babysitting business.

**Question ID: 94815965 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Yussef is 42 and single. He provided all the costs of keeping up his home for the year. Yussef's 25-year-old son, Mohamed, lived with him the entire year. Mohamed worked part-time and earned only $7,100 in wages. Yussef provided more than one-half of his son's support. Can Yussef claim his son as a dependent?

A. Yes, he can claim his son as a dependent and also file as head of household. 
B. No, he cannot claim his son as a dependent. correct
C. He can claim his son as a qualifying relative, but he cannot claim head of household. 
D. He can claim his son only if his son is a full-time student. 

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Yussef cannot claim his son as a dependent. Mohamed does not meet the "age test" to be a qualifying child (he is 25). Furthermore, although Mohamed only worked part-time, he earned too much for Yussef to claim him as a qualifying relative dependent. A "qualifying relative" must satisfy the "gross income" test, which means that they cannot earn more than $4,700 (the "deemed exemption" amount) in 2023. Therefore, Yussef cannot claim his son as a dependent, and he also cannot file Head of Household because he does not have a qualifying person.
