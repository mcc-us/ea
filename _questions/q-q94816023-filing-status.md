Question ID: 94816023 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Q. Manny is recently divorced. He provided all the costs of keeping up his home for the year. Manny's son, Franklin, lived with him the entire year. Franklin is 23 years old and was not a full-time student during the tax year. Franklin earned $5,600 from a part-time job during the year. Based on these facts, what is the BEST filing status for Manny?

A. The best filing status for Manny would be Head of Household.

Here's why:

- Maintains a household: Manny provided all the costs of keeping up his home, even though his son is over 18.

- Qualifying child: Franklin is a qualifying child because he lived with Manny for more than half of the year, is under 24 years old, and is not a full-time student.

- Child's income: Franklin's income is less than the exemption amount for 2023 ($11,000), so it does not affect Manny's filing status.

Filing as Head of Household gives Manny a higher standard deduction than single or married filing jointly, which will result in a lower tax bill.
