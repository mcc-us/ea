Example:

William, unmarried, earns \$60,000. His 22-year-old cousin, Jimmy, lives with him. Jimmy attends college and earns $3,100.

#### Why can't William file as Head of Household (HOH)?

- HOH requires a qualifying person (child, stepchild, parent, etc.).
- Cousins are not qualifying persons for HOH.

But, why can William claim Jimmy as a qualifying relative?

- Jimmy is not William's qualifying child.
- Jimmy lived with William all year.
- Jimmy's income (\$3,100) is **below the exemption amount, $4700**.
- William likely provided more than half of Jimmy's support.

#### Steps for William:

- Confirm support: Ensure he provided over 50% of Jimmy's support.
- File as Single: William cannot file as HOH.
- Claim Jimmy as a dependent: Benefit from dependent exemption or credits.

#### Conclusion:

- William cannot file as HOH due to Jimmy's relationship.
- However, he can claim Jimmy as a qualifying relative, potentially reducing his tax liability.

Jillian and Olden were married on February 20, 2023 and lived together all year. On January 2, 2024, Jillian moves out of the marital home and files for an annulment on the basis of fraud. Her annulment is granted on February 28, 2024. Neither taxpayer has any dependents. What is Jillian’s filing status for 2023?

A. Single.  
B. Head of household.
C. Married filing separately.
D. Married filing jointly.

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 79% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Jillian must file as single. Unlike a divorce, an annulment is retroactive. A court decree of annulment holds that no valid marriage ever existed. Therefore, the taxpayer is considered unmarried even if she filed joint returns for earlier years. The taxpayer must file amended tax returns claiming single or HOH status (if applicable) for each tax year affected by the annulment that is not closed by the statute of limitations for filing a tax return. The statute of limitations generally does not end until three years after the original return was filed.

Let's simplify this question and answer step by step:

### Question: Can a registered domestic partner be considered a dependent of their partner when it comes to excluding medical expense reimbursements from taxes (under section 105(b))?

### Answer (in simple terms):
Yes, a registered domestic partner (let's call them **Partner A**) can be treated as a dependent for tax purposes regarding **medical expense reimbursements**. This means **Partner B** can get tax-free reimbursements for medical expenses paid for **Partner A, only if certain conditions are met**.

The key condition is that **Partner B** must provide enough financial support to **Partner A** (called the "support requirement"). This rule is similar to how you qualify someone as a dependent on your taxes, but there's an important difference:
- Normally, for someone to be your dependent under tax rules, their **income must be below a certain amount**.
- However, under **section 105(b)** (which deals with medical expense reimbursements), **Partner A's income doesn't matter**. As long as **Partner B** meets the support requirement, Partner A can still be considered a dependent for this specific purpose.

### Example:
If **Partner B** provides most of the financial support for **Partner A**, then **Partner A** can be considered a dependent. This means that **Partner B** can get tax-free reimbursements for **Partner A's** medical expenses, even if **Partner A** ***earns a good amount(?) of money***. The income limit normally applies(?) for dependents under other tax rules but does not apply here.

*Q. The phrase "earns a good amount of money" is used in the last paragraph. What does this mean exactly?*

The phrase "earns a good amount of money" in this context refers to **any income that might typically be too high** for someone to qualify as a dependent under other tax rules. Specifically, under the usual rules for claiming someone as a dependent (under section 152(d), for example), the dependent's income has to be **below a certain threshold** (called the "exemption amount"). If their income is too high, they generally **cannot be claimed as a dependent**.

However, regarding **section 105(b)** (which deals with tax-free medical reimbursements), this **income limit doesn't apply**. So, even if **Partner A** earns **more than that usual threshold**, they can still be considered a dependent for purposes of medical expense reimbursements, as long as **Partner B** meets the **support requirement**.

In short, **"earns a good amount of money"** here means **" earns more than the normal dependent income limit"**, but that doesn't stop them from qualifying as a dependent for medical reimbursements under section 105(b).---


**Question ID: 94815910 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)**

Francine is divorced and lived with her 21-year-old unmarried son, Barron, all year. Francine paid for all their housing costs and food. Francine provided more than half of her son's total support. Barron earned $5,000 in wages and is not a student. What filing status can Francine use?

A. Married Filing Jointly  
B. Married Filing Separately  
C. Single correct   
D. Head of Household 

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

- Francine is not married, and she cannot claim her son as a dependent or use him as her qualifying child for Head of Household. 
- Barron is not a qualifying child, because he is not a full-time student and over 19. 
- Baron does not meet the gross income test because he made more than the $4,700 (5,000) in 2023. 
- Therefore, she must file her return using the "single" filing status.

B. Married filing jointly.  
C. Single, married filing jointly, or married filing separately.

**Question ID: 94815911 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)**

Wyatt, age 32, is divorced and has no children. He lived with his girlfriend, Florinda, age 31, all year, and was the sole source of her support. Wyatt should file as:

A. Married filing separately.  
B. Either single or head of household.  
C. Single.     
D. Head of household.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Even though Wyatt provided all of Florinda's financial support and she lived with him all year, he does not qualify for head of household because Florinda is not a qualifying person for purposes of the HOH status. For HOH filing status, the qualifying person generally must be related to the taxpayer either by blood, adoption, or marriage (with an exception for foster children legally placed in a home).  Florinda is an unrelated person (his girlfriend) so she is not a qualifying individual for Wyatt to file as head of household, even if he provides all of her support.

**Question ID: 94816044 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)**

Ginny is age 48 and legally divorced. Ginny's unmarried 21-year-old son, Denny, lived with her all year. Denny is not a student and worked a part time job, earning $5,400 in wages, but he did not provide more than one half of his own support. What is Ginny's most favorable filing status?

A. Head of Household   
B. Married Filing Separately  
C. Married Filing Jointly  
D. Single correct  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Ginny can only file Single. Denny is 21 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be his mother's qualifying child. Although Denny only worked part-time, he earned too much for Ginny to claim him as a qualifying relative dependent. Therefore, Ginny must file Single. She cannot file Head of Household because she does not have a qualifying dependent.

Manny is recently divorced. He provided all the costs of keeping up his home for the year. Manny's son, Franklin, lived with him the entire year. Franklin is 23 years old and was not a full-time student during the tax year. Franklin earned $5,600 from a part-time job during the year. Based on these facts, what is the BEST filing status for Manny?

A. Married Filing Jointly.  
B. Married Filing Separately.  
C. Head of Household.  
D. Single.    

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Manny must file "Single". He cannot file as Head of Household and claim his son, Franklin, as a dependent, because Franklin is 23 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be Manny's qualifying child. Although Franklin only worked part-time, he earned too much for his father to claim him as a "qualifying relative" dependent. Therefore, Manny cannot file Head of Household because he does not have a qualifying person. (Question modified from an example in Publication 4491).

A. Qualifying Surviving Spouse  
B. Single   
C. Married filing joint or Married filing separately correct  
D. Married filing joint or Single

She could choose either filing status if she elected to file with her deceased husband. Since Rhett actually died in 2024, Molly would also file as MFS or MFJ for 2024. Taxpayers can file jointly in the year of a spouse's death.

Question ID: 94849696 (Topic: Fringe Benefits)

Rodney is a detective working for a private investigation firm. His employer gives all the detectives who work for them an allowance to purchase business suits to wear while they are on the job. The business suits are not required, but they are strongly encouraged to be worn by the employees while they are on the job. Is any part of the suit allowance taxable to Rodney? Choose the best answer below.

    A. An employer-provided allowance for business suits is illegal and not deductible by either the employee or the employer in any circumstances.
    B. Yes. The suit allowance is fully taxable as W-2 wages, and must be included on the employee's wages.correct
    C. No, the reimbursement for business suits is not taxable to Rodney.
    D. Only a portion of the reimbursement is taxable to Rodney, up to the amount that he would pay for regular uniforms.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

The reimbursement of regular clothing (not uniforms) by an employer is a taxable benefit. All of the allowance is taxable and should be included in the wages reported on Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, subject to federal income tax withholding and FICA withholding. In order for the amounts to be nontaxable, work clothes and uniform allowances and reimbursements must meet the accountable plan rules and:

    Be specifically required as a condition of employment;
    Not be adaptable to general usage as ordinary clothing; and
    Not worn for general usage.

This means that regular business suits would not qualify. However, an employer is allowed to give the employees an allowance that is fully taxable as wages. Then the employer would deduct the wages as a regular business expense. (See IRS Publication 15-B, Employer's Tax Guide to Fringe Benefits).

Manny is recently divorced. He provided all the costs of keeping up his home for the year. Manny's son, Franklin, lived with him the entire year. Franklin is 23 years old and was not a full-time student during the tax year. Franklin earned $5,600 from a part-time job during the year. Based on these facts, what is the BEST filing status for Manny?

A. Head of Household.    
B. Single.    
C. Married Filing Jointly.  
D. Married Filing Separately.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Manny must file "Single". He cannot file as Head of Household and claim his son, Franklin, as a dependent, because Franklin is 23 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be Manny's qualifying child. Although Franklin only worked part-time, he earned too much for his father to claim him as a "qualifying relative" dependent. Therefore, Manny cannot file Head of Household because he does not have a qualifying person. (Question modified from an example in Publication 4491).

Ginny can only file Single. Denny is 21 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be his mother's qualifying child. Although Denny only worked part-time, he earned too much for Ginny to claim him as a qualifying relative dependent. Therefore, Ginny must file Single. She cannot file Head of Household because she does not have a qualifying dependent.

**Question ID: 94815911 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)**

Wyatt, age 32, is divorced and has no children. He lived with his girlfriend, Florinda, age 31, all year, and was the sole source of her support. Wyatt should file as:

A. Either single or head of household.  
B. Married filing separately.  
C. Single.    
D. Head of household.    

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Even though Wyatt provided all of Florinda's financial support and she lived with him all year, he does not qualify for head of household because Florinda is not a qualifying person for purposes of the HOH status. For HOH filing status, the qualifying person generally must be related to the taxpayer either by blood, adoption, or marriage (with an exception for foster children legally placed in a home).  Florinda is an unrelated person (his girlfriend) so she is not a qualifying individual for Wyatt to file as head of household, even if he provides all of her support.

Since her husband died four years ago, Juniper has lived with her best friend, Marnie, who is also a widow. Juniper is a U.S. citizen and lived with Marnie all year. Juniper had no income and received all of her support from Marnie. Juniper is Marnie's dependent because she lived with Marnie all year as a member of her household.

A. Single    
B. Married Filing Jointly  
C. Head of Household    
D. Qualifying Surviving Spouse  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Marnie can only file Single. Juniper is Marnie's qualifying relative dependent, only because she lived with Marnie all year as a member of her household. This means that Marnie can claim Juniper as a dependent on her return. However, Juniper is not a qualifying person for Head of Household filing status because she is not related to Marnie in one of the ways that is required for Head of Household status (i.e., is one of the following: a child, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them; your sibling, half-sibling, or a son or daughter of any of them; an ancestor or sibling of your father or mother; or stepbrother, stepsister, stepfather, stepmother, son-in-law, daughter in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in law or sister-in-law).

A. Married filing separately.     
B. Head of household.    
C. Single.  
D. Married filing jointly.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

The most advantageous filing status for Dominique is Head of Household. Because she is legally divorced, she could file as Single. However, because she has children and meets the requirements for Head of Household, she should use HOH as her filing status because it will result in a lower tax.

**Question ID: 94815954 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)**

Elise's husband died on May 1, 2023. She has one dependent son, aged 18. What is the most beneficial filing status for Elise in 2023, assuming she does not remarry before year-end?

A. Qualifying surviving spouse (QSS)  
B. Head of Household    
C. Married Filing Separate  
D. Married Filing Jointly    

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

In this scenario, Elise’s best filing status would be "Married Filing Jointly". Elise may file as a surviving spouse with her deceased husband in the year that he actually died. Then, in the following year, her filing status would be "Qualifying Surviving Spouse" if her child was still her dependent. If a spouse dies during the year, the couple is still considered married for the whole year. The surviving spouse can choose either married filing jointly or married filing separately as her filing status, assuming she has not remarried. The executor or administrator must sign the return for the deceased spouse. If no one has been appointed as executor or administrator, the surviving spouse signs the joint return and enters “filing as surviving spouse” on the signature line of Form 1040.

**Question ID: 94816027 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)**

Edgar's wife moved out of their home on November 1, 2023. She has not returned to the marital home. Edgar provides all the cost of keeping up the home for himself, and his dependent child, who is 6 years old. Edgar's wife is noncommunicative and does not respond to his calls. He cannot obtain a signature from her or any of her income information. He has not filed for divorce. What filing status should Edgar use?

A. Head of household  
B. Married filing separately    
C. Single  
D. Married filing jointly (with a disclosure)

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Edgar does not qualify for Head of Household status because he did not live apart from his wife for the last 6 months of the year. And he cannot file jointly with her, because she refuses to communicate or sign a joint return with him. So Edgar is forced to file "Married filing separately" in order to report his income for the year.

**Question ID: 94815907 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)**

Dinah is legally married but has lived apart from her husband since May 1. She has not filed for divorce or legal separation. She provided 80% of the support for her three children who lived with her all year. Which of the following statements is correct?

A. She must file as married filing separately or married filing jointly.  
B. She must file as married filing separately.  
C. She must file as married filing jointly.  
D. She qualifies for head of household filing status.    

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Dinah is “considered unmarried” and can choose to file as head of household. The head of household status is available to taxpayers who meet all three of the following requirements:

The taxpayer must be single, divorced, legally separated, or “considered unmarried” on the last day of the year.
The taxpayer must have paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.
The taxpayer must have had a qualifying person living in her home for more than half the year.

There are exceptions for temporary absences, such as school, and for a qualifying parent, who does not have to live with the taxpayer. A taxpayer who qualifies to file as head of household will usually have a lower tax rate than the rates for single or MFS and will receive a higher standard deduction. To be “considered unmarried” on the last day of the tax year, a taxpayer must meet all of the following conditions:

File a separate return.
Pay more than half the cost of keeping up the home for the tax year.
Not live with her spouse in the home during the last six months of the tax year.
Maintain the home as the main residence of a qualifying child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half the year.
Be able to claim an exemption for the child (although there is an exception for divorced parents).

Anthony is 62. His wife, Marie, died on January 3. Anthony meets someone new and remarries on December 31, to Donatella, age 61. Anthony plans to file a joint return with his new wife, Donatella. What is the filing status for Marie (the deceased spouse)?

A. Married filing jointly  
B. Married filing separately    
C. Single  
D. Qualifying Surviving Spouse (QSS)  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Marie's filing status is married filing separately. If your spouse died during the year, you are considered married for the whole year for filing status purposes. If you didn’t remarry before the end of the year, you can file a joint return for yourself and your deceased spouse. If you remarried before the end of the tax year, you can file a joint return with your new spouse. In that case, your deceased spouse’s filing status is married filing separately for that year.

Her husband moved out of the home in January, so she lived apart from her spouse for at least the last six months of the year. For tax law purposes, she is "considered unmarried". The HOH filing status applies to unmarried individuals (or married individuals considered unmarried) who provide a home for a qualified dependent.

Study Unit 4: Taxable and Nontaxable Income covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

The doctrine of constructive receipt deems income will be taxable when a taxpayer is able to control or access it, even if she or he doesn’t physically possess it. However, income is not considered to have been “constructively received” if a taxpayer declines to accept an item, such as a prize or an award, or if the prize is not received by the taxpayer.

"Income is constructively received when an amount is credited to your account or made available to you without restriction. You do not need to have possession of it. If you authorize someone to be your agent and receive income for you, you are considered to have received it when your agent receives it. Income is not constructively received if your control of its receipt is subject to substantial restrictions or limitations." -Publication 538

Question ID: 94849582 

Paul is a full-time employee of Carpet Warehouse. Paul frequently travels to meet with customers. Paul's employer gives him $500 a month ($6,000 for the year) for his business expenses. Paul does not have to provide any proof of his expenses to his employer and he can keep any funds that he does not spend. His actual expenses for the year were $1,000 for lodging, $600 for meals while away from home, and $2,000 for entertainment, when he took 5 of his best vendors out to a baseball game. What reporting is required of Paul's employer and what reporting is required of Paul?

A. Employer adds $6,000 to wages reported on Paul's Form W-2; Paul can report $3,600 as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A.  
B. Employer adds $6,000 to wages reported on Paul's Form W-2; Paul can report $1,600 as an adjustment to income.   
C. Employer adds $6,000 to wages reported on Paul's Form W-2; Paul cannot deduct the expenses on his tax return.  
D. Employer adds $6,000 to wages reported on Paul's Form W-2; Paul can report $1,600 as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A.  

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

This is a nonaccountable plan. Since Paul does not have to submit any receipts or substantiation to his employer, this means that the employer must add $6,000 to wages reported on Paul's Form W-2. Paul cannot deduct the expenses on his tax return. 

Note: Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, employee business expenses can be deducted as an adjustment to income only for specific employment categories. Armed Forces reservists, qualified performing artists, fee-basis state or local government officials, and individuals with disabilities may still deduct employee expenses on Form 2106.

Question ID: 94849661 (Topic: Fringe Benefits)

Annabelle was offered a consulting position in another state. Her new employer reimbursed her for $5,500 for her moving truck and expenses incurred during the move. How should this reimbursement be treated?

A. Because this is a reimbursement of a nondeductible expense, it is treated as wages and must be included on Annabelle’s Form W-2.  
B. The reimbursement is tax-exempt because it is a qualified moving expense.  
C. The amounts are non-taxable to Annabelle.  
D. The expense is nontaxable as long as Annabelle’s employer makes the payment directly to the moving company.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act suspended the qualified moving expense exclusion and employee deduction for moving expenses. Because this is a reimbursement of a nondeductible expense, it is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan and must be included as compensation on Annabelle’s Form W-2. An employer can still reimburse an employee for their moving expenses, but the amounts are fully taxable as wages. The employer can then deduct the expense (as wages) but the full amount will be subject to payroll taxes as well as income tax for Annabelle.

Note: There is an exception for active-duty members of the armed forces, who still are entitled to claim a deduction for moving expenses. Active-duty military can also receive non-taxable reimbursement for their qualified moving expenses.

Question ID: 94816023 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Q. Manny is recently divorced. He provided all the costs of keeping up his home for the year. Manny's son, Franklin, lived with him the entire year. Franklin is 23 years old and was not a full-time student during the tax year. Franklin earned $5,600 from a part-time job during the year. Based on these facts, what is the BEST filing status for Manny?

A. The best filing status for Manny would be Head of Household.

Here's why:

- Maintains a household: Manny provided all the costs of keeping up his home, even though his son is over 18.

- Qualifying child: Franklin is a qualifying child because he lived with Manny for more than half of the year, is under 24 years old, and is not a full-time student.

- Child's income: Franklin's income is less than the exemption amount for 2023 ($11,000), so it does not affect Manny's filing status.

Filing as Head of Household gives Manny a higher standard deduction than single or married filing jointly, which will result in a lower tax bill.

Question ID: 94816043 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Tammy and Hector are married and have always filed jointly. They have no children or other dependents. Tammy dies on March 4. Hector remarries on November 30, to Jennifer. Jennifer and Hector plan to file jointly. Before Tammy's death on March 4, she had earned $27,000 in wages. What is Tammy's filing status (the deceased spouse) on her final Form 1040?

A. Married Filing Jointly  
B. Married Filing Separate.  
C. Qualifying Surviving Spouse  
D. Single  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 69% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Tammy is required to use the "Married Filing Separate" filing status on her final return. That is the only filing status permitted in this scenario. Taxpayers whose spouses died during the tax year are considered married for the entire year, provided they did not remarry. Since Hector remarried in the same year that his previous wife died, then the deceased spouse’s filing status becomes Married Filing Separately. The executor of Tammy's estate (whether it is her surviving spouse or someone else named in her final will) would be responsible for Tammy's final return.

A. Opal, whose marriage was annulled, but not until January 1 of the following tax year.  
B. Thomas, whose spouse died in March of the tax year.  
C. Paula, who got married to Danny on December 31 of the current tax year.  
D. Halle, who is married and lives apart from her spouse.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 69% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Marital status is typically determined as of the last day of the tax year. However, in the case of an annulment, the marriage is considered to never have happened. An annulment legally nullifies the marriage and return the parties to their prior single status, as if they never married. A taxpayer is considered unmarried (for tax purposes) for the entire Tax Year if, on December 31, any of the following applies:

- The taxpayer has never been married.
- A taxpayer is legally separated (but not under an interlocutory decree of divorce).
- A taxpayer is divorced and the divorce decree was finalized before December 31.
- The taxpayer's marriage was annulled with an official court decree of annulment.
- The taxpayer is still legally married, but was "considered unmarried" for the purpose of qualifying for the Head of Household filing status.

A. She must file as married filing separately.  
B. She qualifies for head of household filing status.  
C. She must file as married filing jointly.  
D. She must file as married filing separately or married filing jointly.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 75% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

- The taxpayer must have paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.
- The taxpayer must have had a qualifying person living in her home for more than half the year.

There are exceptions for temporary absences, such as school, and for a qualifying parent, who does not have to live with the taxpayer. A taxpayer who qualifies to file as head of household will usually have a lower tax rate than the rates for single or MFS and will receive a higher standard deduction. To be “considered unmarried” on the last day of the tax year, a taxpayer must meet all of the following conditions:

- File a separate return.
- Pay more than half the cost of keeping up the home for the tax year.
- Not live with her spouse in the home during the last six months of the tax year.
- Maintain the home as the main residence of a qualifying child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half the year.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Marnie can only file Single. Juniper is Marnie's qualifying relative dependent, only because she lived with Marnie all year as a member of her household. This means that Marnie can claim Juniper as a dependent on her return. However, Juniper is not a qualifying person for Head of Household filing status because she is not related to Marnie in one of the ways that is required for Head of Household status (i.e., is one of the following: a child, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them; your sibling, half-sibling, or a son or daughter of any of them; an ancestor or sibling of your father or mother; or stepbrother, stepsister, stepfather, stepmother, son-in-law, daughter in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in law or sister-in-law).

A. January 23, 2024  
B. January 23, 2025  
C. April 15, 2025  
D. April 15, 2024   

Study Unit 1: Preliminary Work with Taxpayer Data covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 72% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

If Emilio gets his 2020 amended return postmarked on or before April 15, 2024, (taxpayers living in Maine or Massachusetts have until April 17, 2024, due to the Patriot’s Day and Emancipation Day holidays) it will be within the three-year limit and the return will be accepted. But if the amended return is postmarked after this date, it will fall outside the three-year statute of limitations, and he will not receive a refund. There is a statute of limitations on refunds being claimed on amended returns. In general, if a refund is expected on an amended return, taxpayers must file the return within three years from the due date of the original return, or within two years after the date they paid the tax, whichever is later. Returns filed before the due date (without regard to extensions) are considered filed on the due date.

Note: There are a few exceptions to the three-year limit on the IRS Statute of Limitations on refunds. For example, a taxpayer has a longer period of time to claim a loss on a bad debt or worthless security, or for a foreign tax credit or deduction.

3. Question ID: 94850116 (Topic: Use of Prior Years' Returns)

Layla is self-employed and expects to owe $2,500 of taxes for 2023. Her tax liability for the prior tax year was zero because her Schedule C business had a loss in the prior year. Which of the following statements is correct?

A.Layla is not required to pay estimated taxes.  
B. Layla is required to pay estimated taxes.  
C. Layla is required to pay the full amount due before December 31 or she will be subject to an estimated tax penalty.  
D. Layla must pay at least \$1,500 of estimated tax during the year, so she can be under the safe harbor threshold of $1,000 for the year.  

Study Unit 1: Preliminary Work with Taxpayer Data covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 68% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Since Layla had zero tax liability on her prior-year return, she is not required to pay any estimated tax in the current year (as long as she pays the tax due by the unextended due date of her return). A taxpayer must pay estimated tax if both of the following apply:

- The taxpayer expects to owe at least $1,000 in tax after subtracting withholding and credits.
- The taxpayer expects the amount owed after withholding and credits to be less than the smaller of:

     - 90% of the tax to be shown on the current year tax return, or  
     - 100% of the tax shown on the prior-year tax return.  

Note: There is a higher “safe harbor” threshold for higher-income taxpayers. For taxpayers with adjusted gross income of over \$150,000 ($75,000 if married filing separately), the threshold for the amount owed would be 110% of the previous year's tax liability rather than 100%. See the dedicated IRS page for estimated taxes for more information.

C. She can choose to file Head of Household or Married Filing Separately.  
D. She can choose to file Married Filing Jointly or Head of household.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 91% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Camilla may file as Married Filing Separately or as Head of Household. This is because she can be "considered unmarried" for tax purposes. Married taxpayers who lived apart from their spouse during the last six months of the year and provided for dependent children may be “considered unmarried” and qualify to file as Head of Household. 

To be "considered unmarried" at the end of a tax year, the taxpayer's spouse may not be a member of the household for the last 6 months of the tax year and the taxpayer must also have a qualifying dependent. In this scenario, Camilla's home must have been the main home of a child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half the year. Since her son lived with her all year, then she would qualify. She cannot file jointly (MFJ) with her estranged husband because, as the question states, he refuses to file jointly with her. In the case of an MFJ return, both spouses must agree to file jointly and sign the return.

9. Question ID: 94850155 (Topic: Filing Requirements and Due Date)

Percy filed his 2020 tax return late. He didn't file it until December 1, 2023. How long does the IRS have to audit the return and assess additional tax after Percy filed it?

A. The IRS must assess additional tax within six years from the received date of Percy's tax return.  
B. The IRS must assess additional tax within eighteen months from the original due date of the return.  
C. The IRS must assess additional tax within two years after Percy files it.  
D. The IRS must assess additional tax within three years from the received date of Percy's tax return.  

Study Unit 1: Preliminary Work with Taxpayer Data covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 74% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

The IRS must assess additional tax within three years from the received date of Percy's tax return. The general rule is that if the IRS wants to assess additional tax on a return, the assessment of tax must be made within three years from the received date of an original tax return or three years from the due date of the original return, whichever is later. Since Percy's return is delinquent, the IRS will have three years from the date they receive Percy's return to audit the return or assess additional tax. 

Note: There are some instances when the IRS has a longer time period to assess additional tax. If you omitted more than 25% of your gross income from a tax return, the time the IRS can assess additional tax increases from three to six years from the date your tax return was filed. On a fraudulent return, the IRS has an unlimited amount of time to assess tax.

14. Question ID: 97091963 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Daniel is divorced and earns $70,000 in wages. He has several relatives which he supports. These relatives do not all live with him, but none earn any income. Which dependent relative may qualify Daniel for head of household filing status?

A. A parent who lives in a retirement home, and not with Daniel.  
B. A foster child who lived with Daniel for 3 months of the tax year.  
C. A cousin who lives with Daniel all year.  
D. An adult stepdaughter who lives in her own apartment who is supported by Daniel.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 79% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

A parent is the only dependent relative who does not have to live with Daniel for him to claim “head of household” status. In order to file for head of household, the “qualifying person” must be one of the following: a birth child, adopted child, grandchild, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of those, or a parent. The qualifying person must also LIVE WITH the taxpayer (unless the absence is temporary). The only exception to the “residency test” is a parent, who does not have to live with the taxpayer. A cousin does not qualify because they do not meet the relationship test. The adopted child does not qualify because the child lived with the taxpayer for less than one-half of the year.

For the purpose of determining filing status, which of the following taxpayers would be considered unmarried for the entire tax year and must file SINGLE in 2023? (None of the taxpayers listed below have any dependents).

A. Halton, whose annulment was finalized on January 10, 2024.  
B. Terrance, whose spouse died on February 1, 2023.  
C. Gregory, who got married on June 1, 2023 to a nonresident alien.  
D. Crystal, who got married on December 25, 2023.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 81% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Halton, whose annulment was finalized on January 10, 2024 would be considered UNMARRIED for all of 2023 as well as any prior years. Unlike divorce, which is the dissolution of a valid marriage, an annulment is retroactive and nullifies the marriage contract. If you obtain a court decree of annulment, which holds that no valid marriage ever existed, you are considered unmarried even if you filed joint returns for earlier years.

19. Question ID: 94850130 (Topic: Marriage Divorce and Injured and Innocent Spouse)

According to the IRS, which of the following factors do NOT weigh in favor of the IRS approving equitable relief?

A. Abuse by the spouse or former spouse.  
B. Poor mental or physical health on the date the taxpayer signed the return or requested relief.  
C. The taxpayer requesting relief still living with his or her spouse.
D. None of the above.  

Study Unit 1: Preliminary Work with Taxpayer Data covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 55% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

If the taxpayer requesting relief still lives with his or her spouse, it would be unfavorable, rather than favorable. “Equitable relief” is designed to provide tax relief from spousal liability (if a taxpayer can't get tax relief under innocent spouse relief or separation of liability). Equitable relief is offered by the IRS to those taxpayers that don't qualify for innocent spouse relief or relief by separation of liability. With equitable relief cases, the IRS looks to see if it would be unfair to hold the taxpayer liable for the taxes even if the taxpayer does not qualify for the other two forms of relief.

Gerry is age 32, single, and has no dependents. He is self-employed and reports his income and loss on Schedule C. He only earned $4,000 in net self-employment income this year. Which taxes will he likely owe?

A. Self-employment taxes

D. Independent contractors reporting net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more.  

Study Unit 4: Taxable and Nontaxable Income covers the information for this question.
 

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Independent Contractors reporting net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more would be subject to self-employment tax. Unearned income, such as capital gains, interest, dividends, and non-business income (such as hobby income, prizes, or income from a lawsuit, etc.) are typically not subject to self-employment taxes. The starting point for self-employment income to trigger self-employment tax is $400 in net profit. If your self-employment income is less than $400 for the year, you don't need to pay self-employment taxes.

### Question: How do registered domestic partners figure out their gross income for tax purposes?

### Answer:
When two people are in a registered domestic partnership, they live in a state where specific rules apply to how they share income. Specifically, for tax purposes, they need to:
1. **Share the money** they both earn as a couple equally. This means that each partner reports **half** of the total money they both made together, even if one partner earned more than the other.
2. If one partner earns **extra money on their own** (separate from what they share, like from a personal business or separate investments), that partner must also report that **individual income** in addition to their combined income.

### Example:
- Partner A makes $60,000 a year from a job.
- Partner B makes $40,000 a year from a different job.

Together, they earned \$100,000. For tax purposes, **each partner reports $50,000** (half of \$100,000), even though their actual earnings differed.

If Partner A also made an extra \$10,000 from a personal business, they would report \$50,000 (half of the combined income) **plus** the \$10,000 from the personal business, making their total reported income \$60,000.

This rule comes from community property laws in certain states, which treat the income of both partners as something to be shared equally for tax purposes.

A. A taxpayer's adult child. 
B. A taxpayer's cousin.

6. Question ID: 94816041 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)

Larry has been divorced from his wife, Angela, for several years. Angela has primary physical custody of their son, according to their final court decree. Angela did not provide any support for their son, because Larry was providing alimony and child support to Angela. The son lived with Angela all year long, but Angela released her right to claim the child as a dependent to Larry. What is Larry's filling status in this scenario?

A. Singlecorrect
B. Married filing jointly
C. Head of Household  
D. Married filing separate

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Using the Form 8332, Angela can release the dependency exemption to Larry. Then the father could claim the child as the noncustodial parent. But he cannot file as head of household, because the child did not live with him. So he would claim single and also claim his son as a dependent.

Note: If a custodial parent releases a claim to exemption for a child, the noncustodial parent may claim the child as a dependent and as a qualifying child for the child tax credit or credit for other dependents. However, the noncustodial parent may not claim the child for the purpose of claiming head of household filing status, the earned income credit, the credit for child and dependent care expenses. See IRS FAQ on this topic here. 

9. Question ID: 94815912 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)

Which of the following would not meet the "relationship test” to be considered a dependent?

A. Cousin.correct
B. Foster child.  
C. Father-in-law.
D. Step-daughter.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

For the relationship test, “family members” do not include cousins, who are treated as unrelated persons. A cousin must live with the taxpayer for the entire year and also meet the gross income test in order to qualify as a dependent. A family member who is related to the taxpayer in any of the following ways does not have to live with the taxpayer to meet the relationship test to be a qualifying relative:

A child, stepchild, foster child, or descendant of any of them (for example, a grandchild).
A sibling, step-sibling, or half-sibling.
A parent, grandparent, stepparent, or other direct ancestor (but not a foster parent).
A niece or nephew, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law.

Any relationship that was established by marriage is not ended by death or divorce. An adopted child is treated the same as a natural child for the purposes of the relationships described above. For example, an adopted brother or sister is a brother or sister of the taxpayer. An adopted child includes a child who was lawfully placed with a person for legal adoption. See more information about Dependency Relationships.

10. Question ID: 94815924 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)

Which of the following is NOT one of the tests for a qualifying child?

A. Relationship test.
B. Residency test.  
C. Disability test.  
D. Age test.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

There is no disability test. The five tests for determining if somebody is a Qualifying child are:

Relationship test
Age test
Residency test
Support test
Tie-Breaker test

To see more information about the rules for qualifying children, see Publication 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information.

**Question ID: 94815956 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Jeong and Rochelle had a child who was born on December 2, 2023. The child only lived for a few hours and died before midnight. Which of the following statements is correct?

A. They cannot claim the child as a dependent on their tax return, because the child did not live with them for more than half the tax year.
B. They cannot claim the child as a dependent on their tax return unless they obtain a Social Security number for the child.
C. They can claim the child as a qualifying child on their tax return, even if they are unable to obtain a Social Security number for the child.correct
D. They cannot claim the child as a dependent on their tax return in the year of birth, but they can do so for the following year, if the child is issued an SSN.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

They can claim the child as a qualifying child on their tax return, even if they are unable to obtain a Social Security number for the child. If a child is born and dies in the same tax year, a Social Security number is not required in order to claim the dependency exemption in that tax year. The tax return must be filed on paper and the taxpayer must enter the word “DIED” in the space normally reserved for the SSN. The rules regarding how to claim an exemption for a deceased child are in Publication 17.

**Question ID: 94850111 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Cecily is in the process of adopting an infant boy. She qualifies to claim the child as a dependent, but she cannot obtain a Social Security number for him yet. If you were preparing Cecily’s income tax return, what would you advise her to do?

A. Not claim the child until the adoption is final.
B. Apply for an ATIN in order to claim the child.   
C. File a tax return on paper and write “adopted” in the line for the SSN.
D. Wait until a valid Social Security number is issued in order to claim the child.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Cecily can request an ATIN and claim the child. An ATIN is an adoption taxpayer identification number, issued by the IRS as a temporary taxpayer identification number for the child in a domestic adoption when a taxpayer is unable to obtain the child’s Social Security number. An adopting taxpayer can use the ATIN on her tax return to identify the child while final domestic adoption is pending.

**Question ID: 94815878 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

With respect to the determination of the “residency test” for dependent children, which of the following does not qualify as a “temporary absence”?

A. A long illness that results in long-term hospitalization.
B. A year-long sabbatical outside the country.  
C. A dependent child who is away at college all year.
D. Military service.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

All of the above are qualified as temporary absences except for the sabbatical. A dependent is considered to have lived with the taxpayer during periods of time when temporarily absent due to special circumstances such as:

Illness
Incarceration (in a juvenile facility)
Education,
Vacation, or
Military service.

It must be reasonable to assume that the absent person will return to the home after the temporary absence. This information is found in the Filing Status chapter of IRS Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax.

**Question ID: 94849883 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

In most cases, a child of divorced or separated parents is the qualifying child of the custodial parent. However, the child may be treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent if:

A. The custodial parent provides the noncustodial parent with Form 8332 to release the exemption for the child.  
B. If the noncustodial parent has a court order allowing him or her to claim the child.
C. If the custodial parent gives verbal consent to the noncustodial parent to claim the child.
D. None of the answers is correct.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

In most cases, a child of divorced or separated parents is the qualifying child of the custodial parent. However, the child may be treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent if the custodial parent provides the noncustodial parent with Form 8332 to release the exemption for the child. See Publication 1819 for information about how a custodial parent can release an exemption to a noncustodial parent. 

**Question ID: 94816024 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Melanie is 65 and unmarried. Melanie works full time and earned $56,000 in wages during the year. Melanie lives with her cousin, Anna, who is 45 and a widow. Anna is unemployed and lived with Melanie all year. Anna received all of her support from Melanie. Based on these facts, which of the answers below best describes Melanie's filing status and tax filing obligations?

A. Melanie can file "Head of Household". She can claim Anna as her qualifying child.
B. Melanie must file "Single". She can claim Anna as her qualifying child.
C. Melanie can file "Head of Household". She can claim Anna as her qualifying relative and claim EITC.
D. Melanie must file "Single". She can claim Anna as her qualifying relative.    

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Melanie must file Single. She can claim Anna as her qualifying relative. Anna is not a qualifying person for Head of Household filing status because she is not related to Melanie in one of the ways listed on the chart in Publication 17 (i.e. "cousins" are not considered related persons for tax purposes). Therefore, Anna is Melanie's "qualifying relative" dependent only because she lived with Melanie all year as a member of her household. (Question modified from an example in Publication 4491). See the IRS chart: Who Is a Qualifying Person Qualifying You To File as Head of Household?

**Question ID: 94816036 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Matthew is 32 years old and works full time. Matthew's 19-year old cousin, Bruno, lived with him all year. Bruno did not work, and had no taxable income. Bruno's parents are deceased, and no one else can claim him as a dependent. Matthew supported his cousin completely. Would Bruno meet the tests to be Matthew's Qualifying Relative?

A. Bruno must be a full-time student in order to be claimed as a dependent
B. Bruno cannot be claimed by anyone because he is a legal adult
C. No, because cousins are not considered "family members" for the purpose of this rule.
D. Bruno would meet the tests to be Matthew's Qualifying Relative.  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Bruno would meet the tests to be Matthew's Qualifying Relative. Although cousins are not considered "family members" for the relationship test for qualifying relatives, the question stated that Bruno lived with Matthew all year. This means that Bruno meets the "Member of Household or Relationship Test" to be Matthew's Qualifying Relative. Although Matthew can claim Bruno as a dependent, he cannot file as Head of Household, because a cousin is not a qualifying relationship for HOH status.

*While Bruno qualifies as Matthew's Qualifying Relative by living with him all year, Matthew cannot file as Head of Household. This is because cousins do not meet the specific relationship requirements for Head of Household status.*

See the IRS chart: Who Is a Qualifying Person Qualifying You To File as Head of Household?

Question ID: 95850131 (Topic: Employee Compensation and Worker Classification)

How can misclassifying workers adversely affect an employee with regard to their income taxes?

A. Because the employer does not pay their portion of the payroll taxes and also does not withhold the employee's portion.correct
B. Because the employee cannot determine how much compensation they received.
C. Because a misclassified worker has committed a crime.

**Question ID: 94815954 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)**

Elise's husband died on May 1, 2023. She has one dependent son, aged 18. What is the most beneficial filing status for Elise in 2023, assuming she does not remarry before year-end?

A. Married Filing Jointly.  
B. Qualifying surviving spouse (QSS)  
C. Head of Household  
D. Married Filing Separate  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

In this scenario, Elise’s best filing status would be "Married Filing Jointly". Elise may file as a surviving spouse with her deceased husband in the year that he actually died. Then, in the following year, her filing status would be "Qualifying Surviving Spouse" if her child was still her dependent. If a spouse dies during the year, the couple is still considered married for the whole year. The surviving spouse can choose either married filing jointly or married filing separately as her filing status, assuming she has not remarried. The executor or administrator must sign the return for the deceased spouse. If no one has been appointed as executor or administrator, the surviving spouse signs the joint return and enters “filing as surviving spouse” on the signature line of Form 1040.

6. Question ID: 94815911 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Wyatt, age 32, is divorced and has no children. He lived with his girlfriend, Florinda, age 31, all year, and was the sole source of her support. Wyatt should file as:

A. Married filing separately.  
B. Either single or head of household. wrong  
C. Head of household.  
D. Single.  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Even though Wyatt provided all of Florinda's financial support and she lived with him all year, he does not qualify for head of household because Florinda is not a qualifying person for purposes of the HOH status. For HOH filing status, the qualifying person generally must be related to the taxpayer either by blood, adoption, or marriage (with an exception for foster children legally placed in a home).  Florinda is an unrelated person (his girlfriend) so she is not a qualifying individual for Wyatt to file as head of household, even if he provides all of her support. 

13. Question ID: 94816044 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Ginny is age 48 and legally divorced. Ginny's unmarried 21-year-old son, Denny, lived with her all year. Denny is not a student and worked a part time job, earning $5,400 in wages, but he did not provide more than one half of his own support. What is Ginny's most favorable filing status?

A. Single.  
B. Head of Household    
C. Married Filing Jointly  
D. Married Filing Separately  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Ginny can only file Single. Denny is 21 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be his mother's qualifying child. Although Denny only worked part-time, he earned too much for Ginny to claim him as a qualifying relative dependent. Therefore, Ginny must file Single. She cannot file Head of Household because she does not have a qualifying dependent.

15. Question ID: 94815885 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Jackie and Keoni are divorced and their 10-year-old daughter lives with Jackie. Keoni pays child support to Jackie. Jackie is trying to decide if she qualifies to file as Head of Household.

A. The cost of textbooks for her daughter.   
B. Property taxes on the home.  
C. Mortgage interest.  
D. Food eaten at home.   

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Jackie cannot include the cost of textbooks for her daughter's education as part of her expenses, because it is not a cost for “keeping up the home”.  She may include the rest of the expenses, however.

18. Question ID: 94816017 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

C. The taxpayer paid more than half of the cost of keeping up the home for the entire year.  
D. The taxpayer's spouse did not live in the home during the last 6 months of the tax year.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

In order to claim head of household, the taxpayer must have a qualifying dependent, but it does not have to be a foster child. It can be a child, step-child, or other qualifying dependent. All of the other choices are true.

21. Question ID: 94815910 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Francine is divorced and lived with her 21-year-old unmarried son, Barron, all year. Francine paid for all their housing costs and food. Francine provided more than half of her son's total support. Barron earned $5,000 in wages and is not a student. What filing status can Francine use?

A. Head of Household wrong  
B. *Single correct  
C. Married Filing Jointly  
D. Married Filing Separately   

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Francine is not married, and she cannot claim her son as a dependent or use him as her qualifying child for Head of Household. Barron does not meet the "age" test for a qualifying child, because he is not a full-time student. And he does not meet the gross income test for a qualifying relative, because he made more than the deemed exemption amount of $4,700 in 2023. Therefore, she must file her return using the "single" filing status.

B. Medical treatments paid for a dependent.   
C. Food eaten in the home. wrong  
D. Home mortgage payment.

23. Question ID: 94816023 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Manny is recently divorced. He provided all the costs of keeping up his home for the year. Manny's son, Franklin, lived with him the entire year. Franklin is 23 years old and was not a full-time student during the tax year. Franklin earned $5,600 from a part-time job during the year. Based on these facts, what is the BEST filing status for Manny?

A. Single.
B. Married Filing Jointly.  
C. Married Filing Separately.  
D. Head of Household.   

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Manny must file "Single". He cannot file as Head of Household and claim his son, Franklin, as a dependent, because Franklin is 23 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be Manny's qualifying child. Although Franklin only worked part-time, he earned too much for his father to claim him as a "qualifying relative" dependent. Therefore, Manny cannot file Head of Household because he does not have a qualifying person. (Question modified from an example in Publication 4491).

26. Question ID: 94816045 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Since her husband died four years ago, Juniper has lived with her best friend, Marnie, who is also a widow. Juniper is a U.S. citizen and lived with Marnie all year. Juniper had no income and received all of her support from Marnie. Juniper is Marnie's dependent because she lived with Marnie all year as a member of her household. Marnie earned $47,000 in wages during the year. What is Marnie's filing status?

A. Married Filing Jointly  
B. Head of Household  
C. Single.  
D. Qualifying Surviving Spouse  

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Marnie can only file Single. Juniper is Marnie's qualifying relative dependent, only because she lived with Marnie all year as a member of her household. This means that Marnie can claim Juniper as a dependent on her return. However, Juniper is not a qualifying person for Head of Household filing status because she is not related to Marnie in one of the ways that is required for Head of Household status (i.e., is one of the following: a child, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them; your sibling, half-sibling, or a son or daughter of any of them; an ancestor or sibling of your father or mother; or stepbrother, stepsister, stepfather, stepmother, son-in-law, daughter in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in law or sister-in-law). See guidance in Publication 4491, Who Is a Qualifying Person Qualifying You To File as Head of Household?

27. Question ID: 94816043 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Tammy and Hector are married and have always filed jointly. They have no children or other dependents. Tammy dies on March 4. Hector remarries on November 30, to Jennifer. Jennifer and Hector plan to file jointly. Before Tammy's death on March 4, she had earned $27,000 in wages. What is Tammy's filing status (the deceased spouse) on her final Form 1040?

A. Married Filing Separate.  
B. Qualifying Surviving Spouse  
C. Married Filing Jointly wrong  
D. Single  


Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Tammy is required to use the "Married Filing Separate" filing status on her final return. That is the only filing status permitted in this scenario. Taxpayers whose spouses died during the tax year are considered married for the entire year, provided they did not remarry. Since Hector remarried in the same year that his previous wife died, then the deceased spouse’s filing status becomes Married Filing Separately. The executor of Tammy's estate (whether it is her surviving spouse or someone else named in her final will) would be responsible for Tammy's final return.

28. Question ID: 94815938 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

For the purpose of determining filing status, which of the following taxpayers would be treated as an unmarried individual for the entire tax year?

A. Thomas, whose spouse died in March of the tax year. wrong  
B. Halle, who is married and lives apart from her spouse.  
C. Opal, whose marriage was annulled, but not until January 1 of the following tax year.  
D. Paula, who got married to Danny on December 31 of the current tax year. 

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Marital status is typically determined as of the last day of the tax year. However, in the case of an annulment, the marriage is considered to never have happened. An annulment legally nullifies the marriage and return the parties to their prior single status, as if they never married. A taxpayer is considered unmarried (for tax purposes) for the entire Tax Year if, on December 31, any of the following applies:

The taxpayer has never been married.
A taxpayer is legally separated (but not under an interlocutory decree of divorce).
A taxpayer is divorced and the divorce decree was finalized before December 31.
The taxpayer's marriage was annulled with an official court decree of annulment.
The taxpayer is still legally married, but was "considered unmarried" for the purpose of qualifying for the Head of Household filing status.

A. Single.

2. Question ID: 94816027 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Edgar's wife moved out of their home on November 1, 2023. She has not returned to the marital home. Edgar provides all the cost of keeping up the home for himself, and his dependent child, who is 6 years old. Edgar's wife is noncommunicative and does not respond to his calls.

A. Single  
B. Married filing jointly (with a disclosure)  
C. Married filing separately correct  
D. Head of household  

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Edgar does not qualify for Head of Household status because he did not live apart from his wife for the last 6 months of the year. And he cannot file jointly with her, because she refuses to communicate or sign a joint return with him. So Edgar is forced to file "Married filing separately" in order to report his income for the year.

9. Question ID: 94816040 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Jenna and Paul are married and have always filed jointly. They do not have any dependents. On June 10, Jenna has a major disagreement with Paul and moves out of the home.

A. Married filing jointly or Married filing separately  
B. Head of household

Since Paul's wife refuses to file jointly, then he must file a separate return.

10. Question ID: 95404924 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Nadine is 42 and married. She legally separated from her husband last year, and has lived apart from him the entire year. She and her husband do not have any contact and she does not know where he is living now. Nadine provides all of the support for her father, Jonas, who is 75 years old and lives independently in his separate home. Nadine plans to claim her father as a dependent. Which of the following filing statuses is Nadine allowed to use when filing and generally will be the most advantageous for her to use?

A. Head of Household correct
B. Married Filing Separately  
C. Married Filing Jointly  
D. Single  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Nadine can use the Head of Household filing status. In certain situations, a taxpayer can claim a parent as a dependent and file as head of household (HOH). There is no requirement for a dependent parent to actually live in the same household as the taxpayer, but the taxpayer must pay over half of their parent's support for the parent to be treated as a dependent.

11. Question ID: 94816034 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Anthony is 62. His wife, Marie, died on January 3. Anthony meets someone new and remarries on December 31, to Donatella, age 61. Anthony plans to file a joint return with his new wife, Donatella. What is the filing status for Marie (the deceased spouse)?

A. Single  
B. Married filing separately correct  
C. Married filing jointly  
D. Qualifying Surviving Spouse (QSS)  

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

If you didn’t remarry before the end of the year, you can file a joint return for yourself and your deceased spouse. If you remarried before the end of the tax year, you can file a joint return with your new spouse. In that case, your deceased spouse’s filing status is married filing separately for that year.

C. Married filing jointly.  
D. Head of household.  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Her husband moved out of the home in January, so she lived apart from her spouse for at least the last six months of the year. For tax law purposes, she is "considered unmarried". The HOH filing status applies to unmarried individuals (or married individuals considered unmarried) who provide a home for a qualified dependent.

17. Question ID: 94850173 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Patsy and Owen live in Texas, which is common-law state and a community property state. The couple lives together, own a house together, and tell family and friends that they are married. They have two children together. They do not have a formal marriage license, however. What is their filing status?

A. Since Texas is a common-law state, they are likely considered married under state law, and must file either MFJ or MFS.  
B. Since they do not have a formal marriage license, they are each considered "single" for tax purposes.   
C. They are considered unmarried, and each would be able to file as "head of household" by claiming one of their children.  
D. They are considered to be partners in a civil union.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Since Texas is a common-law state, they are likely considered married under state law, and must file either MFJ or MFS. A common law marriage is a legally recognized marriage between two people who have not purchased a marriage license, or had a formal ceremony. Taxpayers who live together in a common-law state may have a marriage recognized by the state, even without a formal license. Currently, the common-law states are: Alabama, Colorado, District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Texas. See the IRS tutorial page about married couples that live in common-law states.

A. Married filing joint or Married filing separately.  
B. Married filing joint or Single  
C. Qualifying Surviving Spouse  
D. Single   

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Since Rhett was still alive in 2023 and they were married for the entire taxable year, Molly's filing status for 2023 would be Married filing jointly or Married Filing Separately. She could choose either filing status if she elected to file with her deceased husband. Since Rhett actually died in 2024, Molly would also file as MFS or MFJ for 2024. Taxpayers can file jointly in the year of a spouse's death.

25. Question ID: 94815950 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Jillian and Olden were married on February 20, 2023 and lived together all year. On January 2, 2024, Jillian moves out of the marital home and files for an annulment on the basis of fraud. Her annulment is granted on February 28, 2024. Neither taxpayer has any dependents. What is Jillian’s filing status for 2023?

A. Head of household.  
B. Single.  
C. Married filing jointly.  
D. Married filing separately.  

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Jillian must file as single. Unlike a divorce, an annulment is retroactive. A court decree of annulment holds that no valid marriage ever existed. Therefore, the taxpayer is considered unmarried even if she filed joint returns for earlier years. The taxpayer must file amended tax returns claiming single or HOH status (if applicable) for each tax year affected by the annulment that is not closed by the statute of limitations for filing a tax return. The statute of limitations generally does not end until three years after the original return was filed.

30. Question ID: 94815907 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Dinah is legally married but has lived apart from her husband since May 1. She has not filed for divorce or legal separation. She provided 80% of the support for her three children who lived with her all year. Which of the following statements is correct?

A. She must file as married filing separately or married filing jointly.  
B. She qualifies for head of household filing status.  
C. She must file as married filing separately.  
D. She must file as married filing jointly.  

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Dinah is “considered unmarried” and can choose to file as head of household. The head of household status is available to taxpayers who meet all three of the following requirements:

The taxpayer must be single, divorced, legally separated, or “considered unmarried” on the last day of the year.
The taxpayer must have paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.
The taxpayer must have had a qualifying person living in her home for more than half the year.

There are exceptions for temporary absences, such as school, and for a qualifying parent, who does not have to live with the taxpayer. A taxpayer who qualifies to file as head of household will usually have a lower tax rate than the rates for single or MFS and will receive a higher standard deduction. To be “considered unmarried” on the last day of the tax year, a taxpayer must meet all of the following conditions:

File a separate return.
Pay more than half the cost of keeping up the home for the tax year.
Not live with her spouse in the home during the last six months of the tax year.
Maintain the home as the main residence of a qualifying child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half the year.
Be able to claim an exemption for the child (although there is an exception for divorced parents).

31. Question ID: 94816030 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Dominique's divorce became final on November 7, 2023. She has sole custody of her two children, who lived with her the entire year. The children are both under the age of 18. She provided more than half of the cost of keeping up the home. What is the best filing status for her for tax year 2023?

A. Head of household.  
B. Single.  
C. Married filing separately.   
D. Married filing jointly.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

The most advantageous filing status for Dominique is Head of Household. Because she is legally divorced, she could file as Single. However, because she has children and meets the requirements for Head of Household, she should use HOH as her filing status because it will result in a lower tax.

32. Question ID: 94816035 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Greta and Johnny are married. Greta is 70 and had a gross income of $12,000 in wages for the tax year. Johnny is 75, and his gross income was $4,000 for the year, and it was all Social Security. Johnny is also legally blind. They plan to file separate tax returns (MFS). Do they have a filing requirement?

A. Yes, both must file, because they have chosen to file separate returns (MFS).  
B. Only Johnny must file a return. Greta is not required to file, because her only income is from wages.  
C. Neither has to file a return, because they are both senior citizens.  
D. Only Greta must file a return. Johnny is not required to file.   

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Both taxpayers must file a return, because they have chosen to file MFS, and the filing threshold for MFS filers is only $5. Married filing separately is a tax status for couples who choose to record their incomes, exemptions, and deductions on separate tax returns.

33. Question ID: 94815894 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

For the purpose of determining filing status, which of the following taxpayers would be considered unmarried for the entire tax year and must file SINGLE in 2023? (None of the taxpayers listed below have any dependents).

A. Gregory, who got married on June 1, 2023 to a nonresident alien.  
B. Terrance, whose spouse died on February 1, 2023.  
C. Crystal, who got married on December 25, 2023.  
D. Halton, whose annulment was finalized on January 10, 2024.  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Halton, whose annulment was finalized on January 10, 2024 would be considered UNMARRIED for all of 2023 as well as any prior years. Unlike divorce, which is the dissolution of a valid marriage, an annulment is retroactive and nullifies the marriage contract. If you obtain a court decree of annulment, which holds that no valid marriage ever existed, you are considered unmarried even if you filed joint returns for earlier years.

35. Question ID: 97091963 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Daniel is divorced and earns $70,000 in wages. He has several relatives which he supports. These relatives do not all live with him, but none earn any income. Which dependent relative may qualify Daniel for head of household filing status?

A. A parent who lives in a retirement home, and not with Daniel.  
B. A cousin who lives with Daniel all year.  
C. An adult stepdaughter who lives in her own apartment who is supported by Daniel.  
D. A foster child who lived with Daniel for 3 months of the tax year.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

A parent is the only dependent relative who does not have to live with Daniel for him to claim “head of household” status. In order to file for head of household, the “qualifying person” must be one of the following: a birth child, adopted child, grandchild, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of those, or a parent. The qualifying person must also LIVE WITH the taxpayer (unless the absence is temporary). The only exception to the “residency test” is a parent, who does not have to live with the taxpayer. A cousin does not qualify because they do not meet the relationship test. The adopted child does not qualify because the child lived with the taxpayer for less than one-half of the year.

36. Question ID: 94815824 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Camilla and Ryan are married. Ryan leaves Camilla on March 5, 2023, and moves out. Camilla pays all of the expenses relating to their 5-year-old son, who lives with her all year. Ryan refuses to file jointly with Camilla but also refuses to file for divorce or legal separation. What filing status is available to Camilla?

A. She can choose to file Head of Household or Married Filing Separately.  
B. She can choose to file Married Filing Jointly or Head of household.  
C. She can choose Married Filing Jointly or Single.  
D. She can choose Single or Married Filing Separately.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Camilla may file as Married Filing Separately or as Head of Household. This is because she can be "considered unmarried" for tax purposes. Married taxpayers who lived apart from their spouse during the last six months of the year and provided for dependent children may be “considered unmarried” and qualify to file as Head of Household. 

To be "considered unmarried" at the end of a tax year, the taxpayer's spouse may not be a member of the household for the last 6 months of the tax year and the taxpayer must also have a qualifying dependent. In this scenario, Camilla's home must have been the main home of a child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half the year. Since her son lived with her all year, then she would qualify. She cannot file jointly (MFJ) with her estranged husband because, as the question states, he refuses to file jointly with her. In the case of an MFJ return, both spouses must agree to file jointly and sign the return. 

37. Question ID: 94815949 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

A. Qualifying surviving spouse (QSS).

C. Lacie cannot use the standard deduction; she must itemize her deductions.

**Question ID: 95414357 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Gerry is age 62 and unmarried. He has no children, but he has several relatives living with him. All of the people listed below lived with Gerry all year long, and did not provide more than one-half of their own financial support. Which of them can be claimed by Gerry as a "qualifying relative" dependent on his tax return?

A. Douglas, his 85-year-old father, who took a $3,900 distribution from his 401(k), and also had $3,100 in capital gains. wrong
B. Shawn, his cousin, who is 26 years old and earned $4,300 from a part-time job. Shawn is not a student. correct
C. Alex, his nephew, who is age 20 and not a student. Alex did not work, but won $4,900 on a slot machine at a local casino. 
D. Karina, his 83-year-old mother, who took a $16,900 distribution from her traditional IRA. 

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Only Shawn, his cousin, could be claimed as a qualifying relative. This is because all of the other people listed have income over the "deemed exemption" amount. Shawn earned $4,300 from a part-time job, which is under the gross income limit for qualifying relatives. A qualifying relative dependent must have made less than $4,700 in gross income during 2023.

Note: Alex, his nephew, does not qualify to be claimed as a "qualifying child" because he does not meet the age test. To meet the qualifying child test, a child must be younger than 19 years old or be a "student" younger than 24 years old as of the end of the calendar year. Since Alex is 20 and not a student, then he can only be claimed as a qualifying relative dependent. And since he made more than the deemed exemption amount, he cannot be claimed at all. Learn more about the rules for dependency in Publication 929, Tax Rules for Children and Dependents.

**Question ID: 94816042 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

With regards to a child of divorced or separated parents, how does the IRS define the "custodial parent"?

A. The custodial parent is the parent who pays for the majority of the household costs for the home in which the dependent lives.
B. The custodial parent is the parent who has physical custody of the child for the greater portion of the calendar year.correct
C. The custodial parent is the parent who supports the child financially.
D. The custodial parent is the parent who is listed on the court documents with primary custody.wrong

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

The IRS defines a "custodial parent" as the parent who has physical custody of the child for the greater portion of the calendar year. However, the child will be treated as the dependent of the noncustodial parent if the custodial parent releases a claim to exemption for a child using Form 8332.

**Question ID: 94816018 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

All the following qualify as a dependent except:

A. Your 23 year-old daughter who is not a student and earned $4,800. She lived with you all year and you provided more than half of her total support.correct
B. Your deceased wife’s mother, who is 65 and lived with you for 11 months during the tax year. She had no income and filed no tax return. You provided more than half of her total support.
C. Your 18 year old son who filed a joint return with his wife to receive a refund of all his withholding. No tax liability would have been due even if they had filed separate returns. All other exemption tests are met.wrong
D. Your 18 year-old niece who is a resident of Mexico but lived with you for 10 months. She earned $500 during the summer and you provided more than half of her total support.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

A 23 year-old daughter who is NOT a student and earned $4,800 cannot be a dependent (unless she is disabled), because she does not meet the age test and she earned more than the deemed exemption amount for qualifying relatives (if the dependent is being claimed under the qualifying relative rules, the dependent's gross income must be less than $4,700 for the year). (This question is based on a prior year exam question)

**Question ID: 94815825 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Corban is divorced from his former wife, Sabine. They have a 5-year-old daughter together, named Lucie. Sabine is the custodial parent, but Corban provides more than half of his daughter's support and also takes care of his daughter on weekends. Corban wants to claim Lucie as a dependent on his tax return. Which of the following is true?

A. Corban can claim Lucie as a dependent if he files jointly with his ex-wife.

C. Corban cannot claim Lucie as a dependent because he is the noncustodial parent. 
D. Corban can claim Lucie as a dependent if his former wife agrees and signs Form 8332. correct

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Corban can claim Lucie as a dependent if his former wife agrees and signs Form 8332. Corban is the noncustodial parent, and Sabine is the custodial parent. The Form 8332 allows the custodial parent (Sabine) to sign away the right to claim dependent children for the current year and future years, if they wish.

**Question ID: 94815831 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Mandy and Kenneth are divorced. They share custody of two minor children. Mandy is the custodial parent and the children live with her most of the year. Mandy will allow Kenneth to claim both children this year, as part of their divorce agreement. If Mandy allows Kenneth to claim the dependency exemption, what form needs to be completed by Mandy?

A. Form 8863 must be completed by Mandy and attached to Kenneth's return.
B. Form 1098-T must be completed by Mandy and attached to Kenneth's return.
C. Form 8332 must be completed by Mandy and attached to Kenneth's return.correct
D. Form 8832 must be completed by Kenneth and attached to Mandy's return.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Form 8332 must be completed by Mandy and attached to Kenneth's return, because Kenneth is the non-custodial parent and Mandy is releasing the exemption to him. Form 8332, Release/Revocation of Release of Claim to Exemption for Child by Custodial Parent, must be filled out and attached to the return. Attaching the divorce decree is not sufficient.

**Question ID: 94815917 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Lola and Ramirus, a married couple, have financially supported Lola's elderly mother, Viola, for many years. They claim Viola as their dependent parent on their jointly filed return. On January 3, 2023, Lola dies (the wife) and Ramirus becomes a widower. Ramirus remarries before the end of the tax year, but continues to financially support his former mother-in-law, Viola, who does not live with him. Can Ramirus continue to claim Viola as a dependent on his tax return when he files jointly with his new wife?

A. No, he cannot claim Viola as his dependent because they are no longer related by marriage.
B. No, he cannot claim Viola as his dependent unless they live in the same household.
C. Yes, he can claim Viola as his dependent on his joint return.correct
D. None of the answers are correct.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Since Ramirus has continued to support Viola, he can claim her as his dependent on the joint return, even though he has remarried. Any dependency relationships established by marriage do not end as a result of death or divorce (for tax purposes). For example, if a taxpayer supports a mother-in-law, he can continue to claim her as a dependent even if he and his ex-spouse are divorced or if he becomes widowed at a later date. 

Note: Treasury Regulations section 1.152-2(d) currently provides that "the relationship if affinity once existing will not terminate by divorce or death of spouse." So the mother-in-law would still be considered "related" to the taxpayer for IRS purposes.

**Question ID: 94815827 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Calista is 16 years old and she has a reputation for being the best babysitter in town. She earns $14,320 by babysitting for family and friends during the tax year, but none of her clients file a 1099-NEC reporting her income. Her parents claim Calista as a dependent and she does not provide more than one half of her own financial support. What is true about Calista's tax situation?

A. Calista is required to file a tax return to report her income and can deduct business expenses relating to babysitting.correct
B. Since Calista did not receive any 1099 forms, she is not required to file a tax return or report her income.
C. Since Calista is under 18, she does not need to file a tax return or report her income.
D. Calista is required to file a tax return to report her income, but she will be exempt from self-employment tax.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Even though she is under 18, the amount of income Calista made exceeds the limit for filing a return. She is required to file a Form 1040, even if she is claimed by her parents. If Calista pursues this babysitting activity with a bona-fide "intent to make a profit", then she is considered self-employed, and her business income would be reported on Schedule C. Calista may also deduct any business expenses relating to her babysitting business.

**Question ID: 94815965 (Topic: Qualifications for Dependency)**

Yussef is 42 and single. He provided all the costs of keeping up his home for the year. Yussef's 25-year-old son, Mohamed, lived with him the entire year. Mohamed worked part-time and earned only $7,100 in wages. Yussef provided more than one-half of his son's support. Can Yussef claim his son as a dependent?

A. Yes, he can claim his son as a dependent and also file as head of household. 
B. No, he cannot claim his son as a dependent.
C. He can claim his son as a qualifying relative, but he cannot claim head of household. 
D. He can claim his son only if his son is a full-time student. 

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Yussef cannot claim his son as a dependent. Mohamed does not meet the "age test" to be a qualifying child (he is 25). Furthermore, although Mohamed only worked part-time, he earned too much for Yussef to claim him as a qualifying relative dependent. A "qualifying relative" must satisfy the "gross income" test, which means that they cannot earn more than $4,700 (the "deemed exemption" amount) in 2023. Therefore, Yussef cannot claim his son as a dependent, and he also cannot file Head of Household because he does not have a qualifying person.

How does the IRS generally determine whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee?

    A. By the number of hours worked
    B. By the location of the worker's home
    C. Based on the individual's job title
    D. By assessing the level of control the employer has over the worker and their dutiescorrect

Question ID: 95850131 (Topic: Employee Compensation and Worker Classification)

How can misclassifying workers adversely affect an employee with regard to their income taxes?

    A. Because a misclassified worker has committed a crime.
    B. Because the employee is usually unable to get a second job.
    C. Because the employer does not pay their portion of the payroll taxes and also does not withhold the employee's portion.correct
    D. Because the employee cannot determine how much compensation they received.

**Question**: Jackie and Keoni are divorced and their 10-year-old daughter lives with Jackie. Keoni pays child support to Jackie. Jackie is trying to decide if she qualifies to file as Head of Household. What expense should she NOT include when calculating if she pays more than half the cost of keeping up the home?

A. Mortgage interest.  
B. The cost of textbooks for her daughter.  
C. Food eaten at home.  
D. Property taxes on the home.  

**Answer**: The correct answer is B. The cost of textbooks for her daughter.

**Explanation**: When determining if Jackie qualifies to file as Head of Household, she must pay more than half the cost of keeping up the home. According to IRS guidelines, qualifying expenses for keeping up a home include things like mortgage interest, property taxes, rent, utilities, and food consumed in the home. However, the cost of textbooks (or other personal expenses like clothing, education, or medical care) is not considered part of the cost of keeping up a home.

Thus, textbooks should not be included when calculating the costs for Head of Household status.

See: IRS **Publication 501** provides further details on this requirement.
