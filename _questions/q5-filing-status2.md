B. A dual-status alien is an individual who is lawfully present in the United States for at least 5 years.  
C. A dual-status alien is an individual who is married to a US Citizen.  
D. A dual-status alien is an individual who is considered to have been both a resident and a nonresident in the same tax year.  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

It is possible to be a US resident alien and a nonresident alien in the same tax year. This usually occurs in the year the taxpayer arrives or departs from the United States. If so, the taxpayer may elect to be treated as a Dual Status Alien for this taxable year and a Resident Alien for the next taxable year if they meet certain tests. Dual status aliens determine their residency status under both the Internal Revenue Code and international tax treaties. A taxpayer cannot file a "dual-status" return on either a Form 1040NR if the taxpayer is a resident alien at the end of the year. The taxpayer would need to file on Form 1040, and attach 1040NR as a statement to the back of the Form 1040. See IRS Publication 519, US Tax Guide for Aliens for more information.
