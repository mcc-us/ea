Q. What is the difference in Schedule C and Schedule SE?

A. They have to be separate forms, because there are some business activities that are not subject to self-employment tax, such as licensed notary income, plus, there are caps to the Social Security portion of the SE tax
   1. Self-employment income (and loss) is reported on Schedule C. 
   2. Schedule F is used by farmers. 
   3. Schedule SE is used specifically for calculating self-employment tax.
