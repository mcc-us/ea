Question ID: 94849696 (Topic: Fringe Benefits)

Rodney is a detective working for a private investigation firm. His employer gives all the detectives who work for them an allowance to purchase business suits to wear while they are on the job. The business suits are not required, but they are strongly encouraged to be worn by the employees while they are on the job. Is any part of the suit allowance taxable to Rodney? Choose the best answer below.

    A. An employer-provided allowance for business suits is illegal and not deductible by either the employee or the employer in any circumstances.
    B. Yes. The suit allowance is fully taxable as W-2 wages, and must be included on the employee's wages.correct
    C. No, the reimbursement for business suits is not taxable to Rodney.
    D. Only a portion of the reimbursement is taxable to Rodney, up to the amount that he would pay for regular uniforms.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

The reimbursement of regular clothing (not uniforms) by an employer is a taxable benefit. All of the allowance is taxable and should be included in the wages reported on Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, subject to federal income tax withholding and FICA withholding. In order for the amounts to be nontaxable, work clothes and uniform allowances and reimbursements must meet the accountable plan rules and:

    Be specifically required as a condition of employment;
    Not be adaptable to general usage as ordinary clothing; and
    Not worn for general usage.

This means that regular business suits would not qualify. However, an employer is allowed to give the employees an allowance that is fully taxable as wages. Then the employer would deduct the wages as a regular business expense. (See IRS Publication 15-B, Employer's Tax Guide to Fringe Benefits).
