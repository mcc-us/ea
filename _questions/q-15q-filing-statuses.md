1. Question ID: 94815910 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Francine is divorced and lived with her 21-year-old unmarried son, Barron, all year. Francine paid for all their housing costs and food. Francine provided more than half of her son's total support. Barron earned $5,000 in wages and is not a student. What filing status can Francine use?

A. Single **correct**   
B. Married Filing Jointly  
C. Married Filing Separately  
D. Head of Household **wrong**  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

- Francine is not married, and she cannot claim her son as a dependent or use him as her qualifying child for Head of Household.  
- Barron does not meet the "age" test (19, or 24 if FT student) for a qualifying child, because he is not a full-time student.  
- He does not meet the gross income test for a qualifying relative, because he made more than the deemed exemption amount of $4,700 in 2023.   
- Therefore, she must file her return using the "single" filing status.

2. Question ID: 94816023 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Manny is recently divorced. He provided all the costs of keeping up his home for the year. Manny's son, Franklin, lived with him the entire year. Franklin is 23 years old and was not a full-time student during the tax year. Franklin earned $5,600 from a part-time job during the year. Based on these facts, what is the BEST filing status for Manny?

A. Head of Household. **wrong**  
B. Single. **correct**   
C. Married Filing Jointly.  
D. Married Filing Separately.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Manny must file "Single". He cannot file as Head of Household and claim his son, Franklin, as a dependent, because Franklin is 23 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be Manny's qualifying child. Although Franklin only worked part-time, he earned too much for his father to claim him as a "qualifying relative" dependent. Therefore, Manny cannot file Head of Household because he does not have a qualifying person. (Question modified from an example in Publication 4491).

Ginny is age 48 and legally divorced. Ginny's unmarried 21-year-old son, Denny, lived with her all year. Denny is not a student and worked a part time job, earning $5,400 in wages, but he did not provide more than one half of his own support. What is Ginny's most favorable filing status?

A. Married Filing Jointly  
B. Head of Household **wrong**    
C. Married Filing Separately  
D. Single **correct**    

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Ginny can only file Single. Denny is 21 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be his mother's qualifying child. Although Denny only worked part-time, he earned too much for Ginny to claim him as a qualifying relative dependent. Therefore, Ginny must file Single. She cannot file Head of Household because she does not have a qualifying dependent.

4. Question ID: 94815911 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Wyatt, age 32, is divorced and has no children. He lived with his girlfriend, Florinda, age 31, all year, and was the sole source of her support. Wyatt should file as:

A. Either single or head of household.  
B. Married filing separately.  
C. Single. **correct**   
D. Head of household. **wrong**  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Even though Wyatt provided all of Florinda's financial support and she lived with him all year, he does not qualify for head of household because Florinda is not a qualifying person for purposes of the HOH status. For HOH filing status, the qualifying person generally must be related to the taxpayer either by blood, adoption, or marriage (with an exception for foster children legally placed in a home).  Florinda is an unrelated person (his girlfriend) so she is not a qualifying individual for Wyatt to file as head of household, even if he provides all of her support.

5. Question ID: 94815918 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Sarah and Daria are registered domestic partners (RDPs) living in California. What is their filing status for federal tax purposes?

A. Single. **correct**   
B. Single, married filing jointly, or married filing separately.  
C. Married filing jointly or married filing separately. **wrong**  
D. Married filing jointly.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

For federal tax purposes, civil unions and registered domestic partnerships are not recognized as legal marriages. The taxpayers must file as single. If Sarah and Daria were to get married at a later date, they would be required to file MFS or MFJ. To see more information about how Registered Domestic Partnerships and Civil Unions are treated for federal tax purposes, see the official IRS FAQ page.

10. Question ID: 94816045 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Since her husband died four years ago, Juniper has lived with her best friend, Marnie, who is also a widow. Juniper is a U.S. citizen and lived with Marnie all year. Juniper had no income and received all of her support from Marnie. Juniper is Marnie's dependent because she lived with Marnie all year as a member of her household. Marnie earned $47,000 in wages during the year. What is Marnie's filing status?

A. Single **correct**   
B. Married Filing Jointly  
C. Head of Household **wrong**  
D. Qualifying Surviving Spouse  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Marnie can only file Single. Juniper is Marnie's qualifying relative dependent, only because she lived with Marnie all year as a member of her household. This means that Marnie can claim Juniper as a dependent on her return. However, Juniper is not a qualifying person for Head of Household filing status because she is not related to Marnie in one of the ways that is required for Head of Household status (i.e., is one of the following: a child, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them; your sibling, half-sibling, or a son or daughter of any of them; an ancestor or sibling of your father or mother; or stepbrother, stepsister, stepfather, stepmother, son-in-law, daughter in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in law or sister-in-law). See guidance in Publication 4491, Who Is a Qualifying Person Qualifying You To File as Head of Household?

Dominique's divorce became final on November 7, 2023. She has sole custody of her two children, who lived with her the entire year. The children are both under the age of 18. She provided more than half of the cost of keeping up the home. What is the best filing status for her for tax year 2023?

A. Married filing separately.  **wrong**  
B. Head of household. **correct**   
C. Single.  
D. Married filing jointly.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

The most advantageous filing status for Dominique is Head of Household. Because she is legally divorced, she could file as Single. However, because she has children and meets the requirements for Head of Household, she should use HOH as her filing status because it will result in a lower tax.

14. Question ID: 94815954 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Elise's husband died on May 1, 2023. She has one dependent son, aged 18. What is the most beneficial filing status for Elise in 2023, assuming she does not remarry before year-end?

A. Qualifying surviving spouse (QSS)  
B. Head of Household **wrong**  
C. Married Filing Separate  
D. Married Filing Jointly **correct**   

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

In this scenario, Elise’s best filing status would be "Married Filing Jointly". Elise may file as a surviving spouse with her deceased husband in the year that he actually died. Then, in the following year, her filing status would be "Qualifying Surviving Spouse" if her child was still her dependent. If a spouse dies during the year, the couple is still considered married for the whole year. The surviving spouse can choose either married filing jointly or married filing separately as her filing status, assuming she has not remarried. The executor or administrator must sign the return for the deceased spouse. If no one has been appointed as executor or administrator, the surviving spouse signs the joint return and enters “filing as surviving spouse” on the signature line of Form 1040.

6. Question ID: 94816027 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Edgar's wife moved out of their home on November 1, 2023. She has not returned to the marital home. Edgar provides all the cost of keeping up the home for himself, and his dependent child, who is 6 years old. Edgar's wife is noncommunicative and does not respond to his calls. He cannot obtain a signature from her or any of her income information. He has not filed for divorce. What filing status should Edgar use?

A. Head of household  
B. Married filing separately **correct**   
C. Single  
D. Married filing jointly (with a disclosure)

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Edgar does not qualify for Head of Household status because he did not live apart from his wife for the last 6 months of the year. And he cannot file jointly with her, because she refuses to communicate or sign a joint return with him. So Edgar is forced to file "Married filing separately" in order to report his income for the year.

7. Question ID: 94815907 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Dinah is legally married but has lived apart from her husband since May 1. She has not filed for divorce or legal separation. She provided 80% of the support for her three children who lived with her all year. Which of the following statements is correct?

A. She must file as married filing separately or married filing jointly.  
B. She must file as married filing separately.  
C. She must file as married filing jointly.  
D. She qualifies for head of household filing status. **correct**   

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Dinah is “considered unmarried” and can choose to file as head of household. The head of household status is available to taxpayers who meet all three of the following requirements:

The taxpayer must be single, divorced, legally separated, or “considered unmarried” on the last day of the year.
The taxpayer must have paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.
The taxpayer must have had a qualifying person living in her home for more than half the year.

There are exceptions for temporary absences, such as school, and for a qualifying parent, who does not have to live with the taxpayer. A taxpayer who qualifies to file as head of household will usually have a lower tax rate than the rates for single or MFS and will receive a higher standard deduction. To be “considered unmarried” on the last day of the tax year, a taxpayer must meet all of the following conditions:

File a separate return.
Pay more than half the cost of keeping up the home for the tax year.
Not live with her spouse in the home during the last six months of the tax year.
Maintain the home as the main residence of a qualifying child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half the year.
Be able to claim an exemption for the child (although there is an exception for divorced parents).

Anthony is 62. His wife, Marie, died on January 3. Anthony meets someone new and remarries on December 31, to Donatella, age 61. Anthony plans to file a joint return with his new wife, Donatella. What is the filing status for Marie (the deceased spouse)?

A. Married filing jointly  
B. Married filing separately **correct**   
C. Single  
D. Qualifying Surviving Spouse (QSS)  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Marie's filing status is married filing separately. If your spouse died during the year, you are considered married for the whole year for filing status purposes. If you didn’t remarry before the end of the year, you can file a joint return for yourself and your deceased spouse. If you remarried before the end of the tax year, you can file a joint return with your new spouse. In that case, your deceased spouse’s filing status is married filing separately for that year.

11. Question ID: 94816005 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Anabelle's husband moved out of their home on January 30, 2023 and has not returned to the marital home.

D. Head of household. **correct**   

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Anabelle has a qualifying dependent, and qualifies for Head of Household filing status. Her husband moved out of the home in January, so she lived apart from her spouse for at least the last six months of the year. For tax law purposes, she is "considered unmarried". The HOH filing status applies to unmarried individuals (or married individuals considered unmarried) who provide a home for a qualified dependent.

Taxpayers who live together in a common-law state may have a marriage recognized by the state, even without a formal license. Currently, the common-law states are: Alabama, Colorado, District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Texas.
