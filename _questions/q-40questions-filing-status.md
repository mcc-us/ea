**Question ID: 94815954 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)**

Elise's husband died on May 1, 2023. She has one dependent son, aged 18. What is the most beneficial filing status for Elise in 2023, assuming she does not remarry before year-end?

A. Married Filing Jointly.  
B. Qualifying surviving spouse (QSS)  
C. Head of Household  
D. Married Filing Separate  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

In this scenario, Elise’s best filing status would be "Married Filing Jointly". Elise may file as a surviving spouse with her deceased husband in the year that he actually died. Then, in the following year, her filing status would be "Qualifying Surviving Spouse" if her child was still her dependent. If a spouse dies during the year, the couple is still considered married for the whole year. The surviving spouse can choose either married filing jointly or married filing separately as her filing status, assuming she has not remarried. The executor or administrator must sign the return for the deceased spouse. If no one has been appointed as executor or administrator, the surviving spouse signs the joint return and enters “filing as surviving spouse” on the signature line of Form 1040.

6. Question ID: 94815911 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Wyatt, age 32, is divorced and has no children. He lived with his girlfriend, Florinda, age 31, all year, and was the sole source of her support. Wyatt should file as:

A. Married filing separately.  
B. Either single or head of household. wrong  
C. Head of household.  
D. Single.  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Even though Wyatt provided all of Florinda's financial support and she lived with him all year, he does not qualify for head of household because Florinda is not a qualifying person for purposes of the HOH status. For HOH filing status, the qualifying person generally must be related to the taxpayer either by blood, adoption, or marriage (with an exception for foster children legally placed in a home).  Florinda is an unrelated person (his girlfriend) so she is not a qualifying individual for Wyatt to file as head of household, even if he provides all of her support. 

13. Question ID: 94816044 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Ginny is age 48 and legally divorced. Ginny's unmarried 21-year-old son, Denny, lived with her all year. Denny is not a student and worked a part time job, earning $5,400 in wages, but he did not provide more than one half of his own support. What is Ginny's most favorable filing status?

A. Single.  
B. Head of Household    
C. Married Filing Jointly  
D. Married Filing Separately  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Ginny can only file Single. Denny is 21 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be his mother's qualifying child. Although Denny only worked part-time, he earned too much for Ginny to claim him as a qualifying relative dependent. Therefore, Ginny must file Single. She cannot file Head of Household because she does not have a qualifying dependent.

15. Question ID: 94815885 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Jackie and Keoni are divorced and their 10-year-old daughter lives with Jackie. Keoni pays child support to Jackie. Jackie is trying to decide if she qualifies to file as Head of Household. What expense should she NOT include when calculating if she pays more than half the cost of keeping up the home?

A. The cost of textbooks for her daughter.   
B. Property taxes on the home.  
C. Mortgage interest.  
D. Food eaten at home.   

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Jackie cannot include the cost of textbooks for her daughter's education as part of her expenses, because it is not a cost for “keeping up the home”.  She may include the rest of the expenses, however.

18. Question ID: 94816017 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Which of the following is not a requirement a taxpayer must meet in order to claim head of household filing status?

A. The taxpayer's home was the main home of a foster child for more than half the year.
B. The taxpayer is unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the year. wrong  
C. The taxpayer paid more than half of the cost of keeping up the home for the entire year.  
D. The taxpayer's spouse did not live in the home during the last 6 months of the tax year.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

In order to claim head of household, the taxpayer must have a qualifying dependent, but it does not have to be a foster child. It can be a child, step-child, or other qualifying dependent. All of the other choices are true.

21. Question ID: 94815910 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Francine is divorced and lived with her 21-year-old unmarried son, Barron, all year. Francine paid for all their housing costs and food. Francine provided more than half of her son's total support. Barron earned $5,000 in wages and is not a student. What filing status can Francine use?

A. Head of Household wrong  
B. *Single correct  
C. Married Filing Jointly  
D. Married Filing Separately   

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Francine is not married, and she cannot claim her son as a dependent or use him as her qualifying child for Head of Household. Barron does not meet the "age" test for a qualifying child, because he is not a full-time student. And he does not meet the gross income test for a qualifying relative, because he made more than the deemed exemption amount of $4,700 in 2023. Therefore, she must file her return using the "single" filing status.

22. Question ID: 94815819 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Which of the following is not a valid expense used to calculate whether a taxpayer is paying more than half the cost of maintaining a home to qualify for the Head of Household filing status?

A. Property taxes.  
B. Medical treatments paid for a dependent.   
C. Food eaten in the home. wrong  
D. Home mortgage payment.  

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

To qualify for head of household filing status, a taxpayer must have paid more than half the cost of maintaining a home. In making the calculation, valid expenses include rent, mortgage payments, property taxes, utilities, home insurance, home repairs, and food eaten in the home. Valid expenses do not include clothing, education, medical treatment, vacations, life insurance, or transportation.

23. Question ID: 94816023 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Manny is recently divorced. He provided all the costs of keeping up his home for the year. Manny's son, Franklin, lived with him the entire year. Franklin is 23 years old and was not a full-time student during the tax year. Franklin earned $5,600 from a part-time job during the year. Based on these facts, what is the BEST filing status for Manny?

A. Single.
B. Married Filing Jointly.  
C. Married Filing Separately.  
D. Head of Household.   

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Manny must file "Single". He cannot file as Head of Household and claim his son, Franklin, as a dependent, because Franklin is 23 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be Manny's qualifying child. Although Franklin only worked part-time, he earned too much for his father to claim him as a "qualifying relative" dependent. Therefore, Manny cannot file Head of Household because he does not have a qualifying person. (Question modified from an example in Publication 4491).

26. Question ID: 94816045 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Since her husband died four years ago, Juniper has lived with her best friend, Marnie, who is also a widow. Juniper is a U.S. citizen and lived with Marnie all year. Juniper had no income and received all of her support from Marnie. Juniper is Marnie's dependent because she lived with Marnie all year as a member of her household. Marnie earned $47,000 in wages during the year. What is Marnie's filing status?

A. Married Filing Jointly  
B. Head of Household  
C. Single.  
D. Qualifying Surviving Spouse  

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Marnie can only file Single. Juniper is Marnie's qualifying relative dependent, only because she lived with Marnie all year as a member of her household. This means that Marnie can claim Juniper as a dependent on her return. However, Juniper is not a qualifying person for Head of Household filing status because she is not related to Marnie in one of the ways that is required for Head of Household status (i.e., is one of the following: a child, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them; your sibling, half-sibling, or a son or daughter of any of them; an ancestor or sibling of your father or mother; or stepbrother, stepsister, stepfather, stepmother, son-in-law, daughter in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in law or sister-in-law). See guidance in Publication 4491, Who Is a Qualifying Person Qualifying You To File as Head of Household?

27. Question ID: 94816043 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Tammy and Hector are married and have always filed jointly. They have no children or other dependents. Tammy dies on March 4. Hector remarries on November 30, to Jennifer. Jennifer and Hector plan to file jointly. Before Tammy's death on March 4, she had earned $27,000 in wages. What is Tammy's filing status (the deceased spouse) on her final Form 1040?

A. Married Filing Separate.  
B. Qualifying Surviving Spouse  
C. Married Filing Jointly wrong  
D. Single  


Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Tammy is required to use the "Married Filing Separate" filing status on her final return. That is the only filing status permitted in this scenario. Taxpayers whose spouses died during the tax year are considered married for the entire year, provided they did not remarry. Since Hector remarried in the same year that his previous wife died, then the deceased spouse’s filing status becomes Married Filing Separately. The executor of Tammy's estate (whether it is her surviving spouse or someone else named in her final will) would be responsible for Tammy's final return.

28. Question ID: 94815938 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

For the purpose of determining filing status, which of the following taxpayers would be treated as an unmarried individual for the entire tax year?

A. Thomas, whose spouse died in March of the tax year. wrong  
B. Halle, who is married and lives apart from her spouse.  
C. Opal, whose marriage was annulled, but not until January 1 of the following tax year.  
D. Paula, who got married to Danny on December 31 of the current tax year. 

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Marital status is typically determined as of the last day of the tax year. However, in the case of an annulment, the marriage is considered to never have happened. An annulment legally nullifies the marriage and return the parties to their prior single status, as if they never married. A taxpayer is considered unmarried (for tax purposes) for the entire Tax Year if, on December 31, any of the following applies:

The taxpayer has never been married.
A taxpayer is legally separated (but not under an interlocutory decree of divorce).
A taxpayer is divorced and the divorce decree was finalized before December 31.
The taxpayer's marriage was annulled with an official court decree of annulment.
The taxpayer is still legally married, but was "considered unmarried" for the purpose of qualifying for the Head of Household filing status.

Sarah and Daria are registered domestic partners (RDPs) living in California. What is their filing status for federal tax purposes?

A. Single.  
B. Married filing jointly or married filing separately. wrong  
C. Single, married filing jointly, or married filing separately.  
D. Married filing jointly.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

For federal tax purposes, civil unions and registered domestic partnerships are not recognized as legal marriages. The taxpayers must file as single. If Sarah and Daria were to get married at a later date, they would be required to file MFS or MFJ. To see more information about how Registered Domestic Partnerships and Civil Unions are treated for federal tax purposes, see the official IRS FAQ page.

D. Married Filing Jointly.  

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Ruth may choose to file as either Married Filing Jointly or Married Filing Separately. For tax purposes, she is considered married to her deceased spouse during the entire year because she did not remarry.

B. Single.  
C. They can choose to file Married Filing Jointly OR Married Filing Separately.

2. Question ID: 94816027 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Edgar's wife moved out of their home on November 1, 2023. She has not returned to the marital home. Edgar provides all the cost of keeping up the home for himself, and his dependent child, who is 6 years old. Edgar's wife is noncommunicative and does not respond to his calls. He cannot obtain a signature from her or any of her income information. He has not filed for divorce. What filing status should Edgar use?

A. Single  
B. Married filing jointly (with a disclosure)  
C. Married filing separately correct  
D. Head of household  

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Edgar does not qualify for Head of Household status because he did not live apart from his wife for the last 6 months of the year. And he cannot file jointly with her, because she refuses to communicate or sign a joint return with him. So Edgar is forced to file "Married filing separately" in order to report his income for the year.

B. Yes, he may file only as MFS or MFJ.   
C. He may not file as head of household, but he can file Single.

A. Married Filing Jointly  
B. Single correct

9. Question ID: 94816040 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Jenna and Paul are married and have always filed jointly. They do not have any dependents. On June 10, Jenna has a major disagreement with Paul and moves out of the home.

A. Married filing jointly or Married filing separately  
B. Head of household

Since Paul's wife refuses to file jointly, then he must file a separate return.

10. Question ID: 95404924 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Nadine is 42 and married. She legally separated from her husband last year, and has lived apart from him the entire year. She and her husband do not have any contact and she does not know where he is living now. Nadine provides all of the support for her father, Jonas, who is 75 years old and lives independently in his separate home. Nadine plans to claim her father as a dependent. Which of the following filing statuses is Nadine allowed to use when filing and generally will be the most advantageous for her to use?

A. Head of Household correct
B. Married Filing Separately  
C. Married Filing Jointly  
D. Single  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Nadine can use the Head of Household filing status. In certain situations, a taxpayer can claim a parent as a dependent and file as head of household (HOH). There is no requirement for a dependent parent to actually live in the same household as the taxpayer, but the taxpayer must pay over half of their parent's support for the parent to be treated as a dependent.

11. Question ID: 94816034 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Anthony is 62. His wife, Marie, died on January 3. Anthony meets someone new and remarries on December 31, to Donatella, age 61. Anthony plans to file a joint return with his new wife, Donatella. What is the filing status for Marie (the deceased spouse)?

A. Single  
B. Married filing separately correct  
C. Married filing jointly  
D. Qualifying Surviving Spouse (QSS)  

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Marie's filing status is married filing separately. If your spouse died during the year, you are considered married for the whole year for filing status purposes. If you didn’t remarry before the end of the year, you can file a joint return for yourself and your deceased spouse. If you remarried before the end of the tax year, you can file a joint return with your new spouse. In that case, your deceased spouse’s filing status is married filing separately for that year.

Anabelle's husband moved out of their home on January 30, 2023 and has not returned to the marital home.

What filing status should she use?

A. Married filing separate.   
B. Single.  
C. Married filing jointly.  
D. Head of household.  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Her husband moved out of the home in January, so she lived apart from her spouse for at least the last six months of the year. For tax law purposes, she is "considered unmarried". The HOH filing status applies to unmarried individuals (or married individuals considered unmarried) who provide a home for a qualified dependent.

17. Question ID: 94850173 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Patsy and Owen live in Texas, which is common-law state and a community property state. The couple lives together, own a house together, and tell family and friends that they are married. They have two children together. They do not have a formal marriage license, however. What is their filing status?

A. Since Texas is a common-law state, they are likely considered married under state law, and must file either MFJ or MFS.  
B. Since they do not have a formal marriage license, they are each considered "single" for tax purposes.   
C. They are considered unmarried, and each would be able to file as "head of household" by claiming one of their children.  
D. They are considered to be partners in a civil union.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Since Texas is a common-law state, they are likely considered married under state law, and must file either MFJ or MFS. A common law marriage is a legally recognized marriage between two people who have not purchased a marriage license, or had a formal ceremony. Taxpayers who live together in a common-law state may have a marriage recognized by the state, even without a formal license. Currently, the common-law states are: Alabama, Colorado, District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Texas. See the IRS tutorial page about married couples that live in common-law states.

Rhett and Molly are married, but they separated on December 20, 2023. They do not have any dependents. Molly was planning to file for divorce, but Rhett dies on January 13, 2024, before Molly can file any legal paperwork. What is Molly's filing status for 2023?

A. Married filing joint or Married filing separately.  
B. Married filing joint or Single  
C. Qualifying Surviving Spouse  
D. Single   

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Since Rhett was still alive in 2023 and they were married for the entire taxable year, Molly's filing status for 2023 would be Married filing jointly or Married Filing Separately. She could choose either filing status if she elected to file with her deceased husband. Since Rhett actually died in 2024, Molly would also file as MFS or MFJ for 2024. Taxpayers can file jointly in the year of a spouse's death.

25. Question ID: 94815950 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Jillian and Olden were married on February 20, 2023 and lived together all year. On January 2, 2024, Jillian moves out of the marital home and files for an annulment on the basis of fraud. Her annulment is granted on February 28, 2024. Neither taxpayer has any dependents. What is Jillian’s filing status for 2023?

A. Head of household.  
B. Single.  
C. Married filing jointly.  
D. Married filing separately.  

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Jillian must file as single. Unlike a divorce, an annulment is retroactive. A court decree of annulment holds that no valid marriage ever existed. Therefore, the taxpayer is considered unmarried even if she filed joint returns for earlier years. The taxpayer must file amended tax returns claiming single or HOH status (if applicable) for each tax year affected by the annulment that is not closed by the statute of limitations for filing a tax return. The statute of limitations generally does not end until three years after the original return was filed.

30. Question ID: 94815907 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Dinah is legally married but has lived apart from her husband since May 1. She has not filed for divorce or legal separation. She provided 80% of the support for her three children who lived with her all year. Which of the following statements is correct?

A. She must file as married filing separately or married filing jointly.  
B. She qualifies for head of household filing status.  
C. She must file as married filing separately.  
D. She must file as married filing jointly.  

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Dinah is “considered unmarried” and can choose to file as head of household. The head of household status is available to taxpayers who meet all three of the following requirements:

The taxpayer must be single, divorced, legally separated, or “considered unmarried” on the last day of the year.
The taxpayer must have paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.
The taxpayer must have had a qualifying person living in her home for more than half the year.

There are exceptions for temporary absences, such as school, and for a qualifying parent, who does not have to live with the taxpayer. A taxpayer who qualifies to file as head of household will usually have a lower tax rate than the rates for single or MFS and will receive a higher standard deduction. To be “considered unmarried” on the last day of the tax year, a taxpayer must meet all of the following conditions:

File a separate return.
Pay more than half the cost of keeping up the home for the tax year.
Not live with her spouse in the home during the last six months of the tax year.
Maintain the home as the main residence of a qualifying child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half the year.
Be able to claim an exemption for the child (although there is an exception for divorced parents).

31. Question ID: 94816030 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Dominique's divorce became final on November 7, 2023. She has sole custody of her two children, who lived with her the entire year. The children are both under the age of 18. She provided more than half of the cost of keeping up the home. What is the best filing status for her for tax year 2023?

A. Head of household.  
B. Single.  
C. Married filing separately.   
D. Married filing jointly.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Greta and Johnny are married. Greta is 70 and had a gross income of $12,000 in wages for the tax year. Johnny is 75, and his gross income was $4,000 for the year, and it was all Social Security. Johnny is also legally blind. They plan to file separate tax returns (MFS). Do they have a filing requirement?

A. Yes, both must file, because they have chosen to file separate returns (MFS).  
B. Only Johnny must file a return. Greta is not required to file, because her only income is from wages.  
C. Neither has to file a return, because they are both senior citizens.  
D. Only Greta must file a return. Johnny is not required to file.   

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Both taxpayers must file a return, because they have chosen to file MFS, and the filing threshold for MFS filers is only $5. Married filing separately is a tax status for couples who choose to record their incomes, exemptions, and deductions on separate tax returns.

33. Question ID: 94815894 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

For the purpose of determining filing status, which of the following taxpayers would be considered unmarried for the entire tax year and must file SINGLE in 2023? (None of the taxpayers listed below have any dependents).

A. Gregory, who got married on June 1, 2023 to a nonresident alien.  
B. Terrance, whose spouse died on February 1, 2023.  
C. Crystal, who got married on December 25, 2023.  
D. Halton, whose annulment was finalized on January 10, 2024.  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Halton, whose annulment was finalized on January 10, 2024 would be considered UNMARRIED for all of 2023 as well as any prior years. Unlike divorce, which is the dissolution of a valid marriage, an annulment is retroactive and nullifies the marriage contract. If you obtain a court decree of annulment, which holds that no valid marriage ever existed, you are considered unmarried even if you filed joint returns for earlier years.

35. Question ID: 97091963 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Daniel is divorced and earns $70,000 in wages. He has several relatives which he supports. These relatives do not all live with him, but none earn any income. Which dependent relative may qualify Daniel for head of household filing status?

A. A parent who lives in a retirement home, and not with Daniel.  
B. A cousin who lives with Daniel all year.  
C. An adult stepdaughter who lives in her own apartment who is supported by Daniel.  
D. A foster child who lived with Daniel for 3 months of the tax year.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

A parent is the only dependent relative who does not have to live with Daniel for him to claim “head of household” status. In order to file for head of household, the “qualifying person” must be one of the following: a birth child, adopted child, grandchild, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of those, or a parent. The qualifying person must also LIVE WITH the taxpayer (unless the absence is temporary). The only exception to the “residency test” is a parent, who does not have to live with the taxpayer. A cousin does not qualify because they do not meet the relationship test. The adopted child does not qualify because the child lived with the taxpayer for less than one-half of the year.

36. Question ID: 94815824 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Camilla and Ryan are married. Ryan leaves Camilla on March 5, 2023, and moves out. Camilla pays all of the expenses relating to their 5-year-old son, who lives with her all year. Ryan refuses to file jointly with Camilla but also refuses to file for divorce or legal separation. What filing status is available to Camilla?

A. She can choose to file Head of Household or Married Filing Separately.  
B. She can choose to file Married Filing Jointly or Head of household.  
C. She can choose Married Filing Jointly or Single.  
D. She can choose Single or Married Filing Separately.  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Camilla may file as Married Filing Separately or as Head of Household. This is because she can be "considered unmarried" for tax purposes. Married taxpayers who lived apart from their spouse during the last six months of the year and provided for dependent children may be “considered unmarried” and qualify to file as Head of Household. 

To be "considered unmarried" at the end of a tax year, the taxpayer's spouse may not be a member of the household for the last 6 months of the tax year and the taxpayer must also have a qualifying dependent. In this scenario, Camilla's home must have been the main home of a child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half the year. Since her son lived with her all year, then she would qualify. She cannot file jointly (MFJ) with her estranged husband because, as the question states, he refuses to file jointly with her. In the case of an MFJ return, both spouses must agree to file jointly and sign the return.
