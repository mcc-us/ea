**Question ID: 94815986 (Topic: Residency Status and/or Citizenship)**

Danika, an international student from Bolivia, received a $6,000 scholarship from Sacramento State University. She is present in the U.S. on a student visa and classifies as a nonresident alien for U.S. tax purposes. The university applied $4,700 of it for tuition, fees, and books. The other $1,300 was used for living expenses at the on-campus dorms. How much must Danika report on her Form 1040-NR as taxable income?

A. $1,300 correct  
B. $0  
C. $6,000 wrong  
D. $4,700  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Different rules apply to nonresident aliens. The University will issue Form 1042-S to her for $1,300; Danika must report $1,300 as a taxable scholarship on Form 1040-NR. A foreign student who is a candidate for a degree may be able to exclude some or all income received under a "qualified" scholarship, if the amounts are used for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and required equipment. Amounts used for other purposes, such as room and board or travel, are not excludable. She would not be eligible for any education credits. To prevent withholding, the international student may file Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding; with the educational institution or other provider of the scholarship (this question is based on a VITA sample question).
