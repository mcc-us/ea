Aimee is a self-employed computer programmer with multiple clients. She works as an independent contractor for Dillon Fireworks, Inc. The company sent Aimee a Form 1099-NEC that shows she received $32,000 for the work she did for them. She received a separate check for $2,800 from Dillon Fireworks for an Accountable Plan Reimbursement for mileage that she incurred while working at a satellite office that Dillon Fireworks also owns. She also received cash payments of $3,500 throughout the year for several small programming jobs. She did not receive any Forms 1099 for the $3,500. How much income should Aimee report on her Schedule C?

Question ID: 95396180 (Topic: Self-Employed Taxpayers)

Gerry is age 32, single, and has no dependents. He is self-employed and reports his income and loss on Schedule C. He only earned $4,000 in net self-employment income this year. Which taxes will he likely owe?

A. Self-employment taxes  
B. Income tax only  
C. He will not owe any taxes because his income is so low  
D. Self-employment taxes and income taxes  

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Gerry will owe self-employment tax. His income is under the standard deduction amount for his filing status, so he will not owe income tax. But he still has a filing requirement, because taxpayers have to file an income tax return if their net earnings from self-employment were $400 or more. The self-employment tax rate is 15.3%. The rate consists of two parts: 12.4% for social security (old-age, survivors, and disability insurance) and 2.9% for Medicare (hospital insurance). For more information, see the IRS Self-Employed Individuals Tax Center.

Question ID: 94815821 (Topic: Self-Employed Taxpayers)

Self-employment tax applies to which of the following individuals?

A. Ministers reporting net earnings from self-employment of $100.  
B. An individual with $2,000 in hobby income.  
C. Investors who report only interest and dividend income.  
D. Independent contractors reporting net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more.  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Independent Contractors reporting net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more would be subject to self-employment tax. Unearned income, such as capital gains, interest, dividends, and non-business income (such as hobby income, prizes, or income from a lawsuit, etc.) are typically not subject to self-employment taxes. The starting point for self-employment income to trigger self-employment tax is $400 in net profit. If your self-employment income is less than $400 for the year, you don't need to pay self-employment taxes.
