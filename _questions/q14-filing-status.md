- Barron is not a qualifying child, because he is not a full-time student and over 19. 
- Baron does not meet the gross income test because he made more than the $4,700 (5,000) in 2023.

**Question ID: 94815911 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)**

Wyatt, age 32, is divorced and has no children. He lived with his girlfriend, Florinda, age 31, all year, and was the sole source of her support. Wyatt should file as:

A. Married filing separately.  
B. Either single or head of household.  
C. Single. correct   
D. Head of household.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Even though Wyatt provided all of Florinda's financial support and she lived with him all year, he does not qualify for head of household because Florinda is not a qualifying person for purposes of the HOH status. For HOH filing status, the qualifying person generally must be related to the taxpayer either by blood, adoption, or marriage (with an exception for foster children legally placed in a home).  Florinda is an unrelated person (his girlfriend) so she is not a qualifying individual for Wyatt to file as head of household, even if he provides all of her support.

**Question ID: 94816044 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)**

Ginny is age 48 and legally divorced. Ginny's unmarried 21-year-old son, Denny, lived with her all year. Denny is not a student and worked a part time job, earning $5,400 in wages, but he did not provide more than one half of his own support. What is Ginny's most favorable filing status?

A. Head of Household   
B. Married Filing Separately  
C. Married Filing Jointly  
D. Single correct  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Ginny can only file Single. Denny is 21 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be his mother's qualifying child. Although Denny only worked part-time, he earned too much for Ginny to claim him as a qualifying relative dependent. Therefore, Ginny must file Single. She cannot file Head of Household because she does not have a qualifying dependent.

Manny is recently divorced. He provided all the costs of keeping up his home for the year. Manny's son, Franklin, lived with him the entire year. Franklin is 23 years old and was not a full-time student during the tax year. Franklin earned $5,600 from a part-time job during the year. Based on these facts, what is the BEST filing status for Manny?

A. Married Filing Jointly.  
B. Married Filing Separately.  
C. Head of Household.  
D. Single. correct  

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Manny must file "Single". He cannot file as Head of Household and claim his son, Franklin, as a dependent, because Franklin is 23 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be Manny's qualifying child. Although Franklin only worked part-time, he earned too much for his father to claim him as a "qualifying relative" dependent. Therefore, Manny cannot file Head of Household because he does not have a qualifying person. (Question modified from an example in Publication 4491).
