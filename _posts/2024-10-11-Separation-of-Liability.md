**Separation of Liability Relief** is a type of relief available under the broader concept of **Innocent Spouse Relief**, specifically for divorced, separated, or widowed individuals who filed a joint tax return with their spouse (or former spouse) but want to separate their responsibility for taxes due to that return.

### Key Points:
- **Separation of Liability Relief** helps you if **you're no longer married or living with the spouse** (with whom you filed the joint return) and want to limit your liability for taxes due to your spouse’s actions.
- **Separation of Liability Relief** is different from general **Innocent Spouse Relief**, where you may seek full relief from liability regardless of marital status, if you meet the other requirements.

### What is Separation of Liability?
- **Separation of Liability Relief** allows a taxpayer to divide or "separate" the responsibility for additional taxes between themselves and their former spouse (or current spouse in some cases), which arise due to errors (e.g., underreporting of income or improper deductions) on a previously filed joint return.
- With this relief, you become responsible for only the tax related to the portion of income you personally earned or claimed on the return, while your spouse or former spouse remains liable for their portion.
  
### How to Request Separation of Liability Relief:
- You request *Separation of Liability Relief* by filing **Innocent Spouse Relief (Form 8857)** given you qualify. 

### Who Qualifies for Separation of Liability Relief?
To qualify you must meet one of the following criteria:
1. **Divorced or legally separated** from the spouse with whom you filed the joint return.
2. **Not living together** with your spouse during the 12-month period ending on the date you file Form 8857 (for Innocent Spouse Relief).
3. You are **widowed** from the spouse with whom you filed the joint return.

### How Does Separation of Liability Work?
- When you file for this type of relief, the IRS will allocate the responsibility for taxes, penalties, and interest between you and your spouse (or former spouse). 
- This applies only to amounts of tax due from *understatements of income OR incorrect deductions/credits* on a joint return.
- If the IRS agrees that you qualify, they will divide the taxes based on the portion of the tax liability attributable to you and your spouse separately. This may include assigning each spouse responsibility for income earned or deductions claimed individually on the return.

### Who CANNOT Qualify for Separation of Liability?
You **cannot qualify** if:
- You **knew** about the items that caused the understatement of tax when you signed the joint return.
- You transferred property to your spouse or ex-spouse as part of a scheme to avoid tax.
- The IRS finds that your request is part of a fraudulent scheme.
  
### Differences Between Separation of Liability and Innocent Spouse Relief:
1. **Innocent Spouse Relief** completely relieves you of liability for unpaid taxes due to your spouse’s actions, whereas **Separation of Liability** divides the liability based on each spouse's respective contribution to the income and deductions.
2. **Innocent Spouse Relief** may be granted even if you are still married, while **Separation of Liability Relief** requires that you be divorced, legally separated, or not living together for the past year.
