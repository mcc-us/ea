title: Separation of liability relief

Separation of liability can relieve you from having to pay your spouse's share of understated taxes from a joint tax return if you're no longer married or living together. The additional taxes due are divided between you and your spouse based on your own incomes and assets. You become responsible only for your share of the tax bill.

Separation of liability can't give you a refund for taxes you already paid. It can only relieve you from paying additional taxes due on your spouse's income and assets.
