title: Separation of liability relief
layout: post
---

Separation of liability can relieve a person from having to pay your spouse's share of understated taxes from a joint tax return if you're no longer married or living together. The additional taxes due are divided between you and your spouse based on the individuals incomes and assets. That person becomes responsible for only their share of the tax.

- Separation of liability **cannot give you a refund for taxes you already paid**. 
- It can only relieve you from paying additional taxes due on your spouse's income and assets.
