6. Question ID: 94816043 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Tammy and Hector are married and have always filed jointly. They have no children or other dependents. Tammy dies on March 4. Hector remarries on November 30, to Jennifer. Jennifer and Hector plan to file jointly. Before Tammy's death on March 4, she had earned $27,000 in wages. What is Tammy's filing status (the deceased spouse) on her final Form 1040?

A. Married Filing Jointly  
B. **Married Filing Separate correct**  
C. Qualifying Surviving Spouse  
D. Single  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 69% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Tammy is required to use the "Married Filing Separate" filing status on her final return. That is the only filing status permitted in this scenario. Taxpayers whose spouses died during the tax year are considered married for the entire year, provided they did not remarry. Since Hector remarried in the same year that his previous wife died, then the deceased spouse’s filing status becomes Married Filing Separately. The executor of Tammy's estate (whether it is her surviving spouse or someone else named in her final will) would be responsible for Tammy's final return.

11. Question ID: 94815938 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

For the purpose of determining filing status, which of the following taxpayers would be treated as an unmarried individual for the entire tax year?

A. **Opal, whose marriage was annulled, but not until January 1 of the following tax year. correct**  
B. Thomas, whose spouse died in March of the tax year.  
C. Paula, who got married to Danny on December 31 of the current tax year.  
D. Halle, who is married and lives apart from her spouse.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 69% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Marital status is typically determined as of the last day of the tax year. However, in the case of an annulment, the marriage is considered to never have happened. An annulment legally nullifies the marriage and return the parties to their prior single status, as if they never married. A taxpayer is considered unmarried (for tax purposes) for the entire Tax Year if, on December 31, any of the following applies:

- The taxpayer has never been married.
- A taxpayer is legally separated (but not under an interlocutory decree of divorce).
- A taxpayer is divorced and the divorce decree was finalized before December 31.
- The taxpayer's marriage was annulled with an official court decree of annulment.
- The taxpayer is still legally married, but was "considered unmarried" for the purpose of qualifying for the Head of Household filing status.

13. Question ID: 94815907 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Dinah is legally married but has lived apart from her husband since May 1. She has not filed for divorce or legal separation. She provided 80% of the support for her three children who lived with her all year. Which of the following statements is correct?

A. She must file as married filing separately.
B. **She qualifies for head of household filing status. correct**
C. She must file as married filing jointly.
D. She must file as married filing separately or married filing jointly.

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 75% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Dinah is “considered unmarried” and can choose to file as head of household. The head of household status is available to taxpayers who meet all three of the following requirements:
- The taxpayer must be single, divorced, legally separated, or “considered unmarried” on the last day of the year.
- The taxpayer must have paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.
- The taxpayer must have had a qualifying person living in her home for more than half the year.

There are exceptions for temporary absences, such as school, and for a qualifying parent, who does not have to live with the taxpayer. A taxpayer who qualifies to file as head of household will usually have a lower tax rate than the rates for single or MFS and will receive a higher standard deduction. To be “considered unmarried” on the last day of the tax year, a taxpayer must meet all of the following conditions:

- File a separate return.
- Pay more than half the cost of keeping up the home for the tax year.
- Not live with her spouse in the home during the last six months of the tax year.
- Maintain the home as the main residence of a qualifying child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half the year.
- Be able to claim an exemption for the child (although there is an exception for divorced parents).

18. Question ID: 94816045 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Since her husband died four years ago, Juniper has lived with her best friend, Marnie, who is also a widow. Juniper is a U.S. citizen and lived with Marnie all year. Juniper had no income and received all of her support from Marnie. Juniper is Marnie's dependent because she lived with Marnie all year as a member of her household. Marnie earned $47,000 in wages during the year. What is Marnie's filing status?

A. Married Filing Jointly  
B. **Single correct**  
C. Head of Household  
D. Qualifying Surviving Spouse  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 72% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Marnie can only file Single. Juniper is Marnie's qualifying relative dependent, only because she lived with Marnie all year as a member of her household. This means that Marnie can claim Juniper as a dependent on her return. However, Juniper is not a qualifying person for Head of Household filing status because she is not related to Marnie in one of the ways that is required for Head of Household status (i.e., is one of the following: a child, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them; your sibling, half-sibling, or a son or daughter of any of them; an ancestor or sibling of your father or mother; or stepbrother, stepsister, stepfather, stepmother, son-in-law, daughter in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in law or sister-in-law).

1. Question ID: 94850152 (Topic: Filing Requirements and Due Date)

Emilio's 2020 tax return was due April 15, 2021. He filed it early, on January 23, 2021. Later, he finds an error on the return, and wants to amend it, expecting the correction to result in a refund. If he gets it postmarked on or before _____________ he will receive a refund from the IRS.

A. January 23, 2024  
B. January 23, 2025  
C. April 15, 2025  
D. **April 15, 2024 correct**  

Study Unit 1: Preliminary Work with Taxpayer Data covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 72% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

If Emilio gets his 2020 amended return postmarked on or before April 15, 2024, (taxpayers living in Maine or Massachusetts have until April 17, 2024, due to the Patriot’s Day and Emancipation Day holidays) it will be within the three-year limit and the return will be accepted. But if the amended return is postmarked after this date, it will fall outside the three-year statute of limitations, and he will not receive a refund. There is a statute of limitations on refunds being claimed on amended returns. In general, if a refund is expected on an amended return, taxpayers must file the return within three years from the due date of the original return, or within two years after the date they paid the tax, whichever is later. Returns filed before the due date (without regard to extensions) are considered filed on the due date.

Note: There are a few exceptions to the three-year limit on the IRS Statute of Limitations on refunds. For example, a taxpayer has a longer period of time to claim a loss on a bad debt or worthless security, or for a foreign tax credit or deduction.

2. Question ID: 94815842 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Lacie and Grant are married and live together all year. They have no dependents. They have always kept their finances separate and choose to file as Married Filing Separately. Grant will be itemizing his deductions this year. What must Lacie do on her MFS tax return?

A. Lacie may use the standard deduction or she may itemize her deductions.  
B. **Lacie cannot use the standard deduction; she must itemize her deductions. correct**  
C. Lacie's itemized deductions must be zero.  
D. Lacie must use the standard deduction; she cannot itemize her deductions.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 65% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for B:

Lacie cannot use the standard deduction; she must itemize her deductions. This is because the spouses are both filing MFS. If one spouse itemizes deductions, the other spouse is also forced to itemize. This rule only applies if both spouses are filing MFS.

3. Question ID: 94850116 (Topic: Use of Prior Years' Returns)

Layla is self-employed and expects to owe $2,500 of taxes for 2023. Her tax liability for the prior tax year was zero because her Schedule C business had a loss in the prior year. Which of the following statements is correct?

A.**Layla is not required to pay estimated taxes. correct**  
B. Layla is required to pay estimated taxes.  
C. Layla is required to pay the full amount due before December 31 or she will be subject to an estimated tax penalty.  
D. Layla must pay at least \$1,500 of estimated tax during the year, so she can be under the safe harbor threshold of $1,000 for the year.  

Study Unit 1: Preliminary Work with Taxpayer Data covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 68% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Since Layla had zero tax liability on her prior-year return, she is not required to pay any estimated tax in the current year (as long as she pays the tax due by the unextended due date of her return). A taxpayer must pay estimated tax if both of the following apply:

- The taxpayer expects to owe at least $1,000 in tax after subtracting withholding and credits.
- The taxpayer expects the amount owed after withholding and credits to be less than the smaller of:

     - 90% of the tax to be shown on the current year tax return, or
     - 100% of the tax shown on the prior-year tax return.

Note: There is a higher “safe harbor” threshold for higher-income taxpayers. For taxpayers with adjusted gross income of over \$150,000 ($75,000 if married filing separately), the threshold for the amount owed would be 110% of the previous year's tax liability rather than 100%. See the dedicated IRS page for estimated taxes for more information.

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 92% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

She must fill out a W-7 application form to request an ITIN, and submit it to the IRS along with a completed tax return. A W-7 Form is used to apply for an individual taxpayer identification number, or ITIN, for nonresidents who are not eligible to receive a Social Security Number. It takes approximately 12 weeks for the IRS to process and issue an ITIN, which will be sent to the taxpayer by mail.

7. Question ID: 94850128 (Topic: Marriage Divorce and Injured and Innocent Spouse)

"Separation of liability” relief does NOT apply to taxpayers who are:

A. **Married taxpayers who are living in the same household. correct**  
B. No longer married.  
C. Living apart for the 12 months prior to the filing of a claim.  
D. Legally separated.  

Study Unit 1: Preliminary Work with Taxpayer Data covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 73% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

“Separation of liability” relief does not apply if the taxpayers are married and living in the same household. To qualify for separation of liability relief, you must have filed a joint return and must meet one of the following requirements at the time you request relief:

- You are divorced or legally separated from the spouse with whom you filed the joint return.
- You are widowed, or
- You have not been a member of the same household as the spouse with whom you filed the joint return at any time during the 12-month period ending on the date you request relief.

8. Question ID: 94815824 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Camilla and Ryan are married. Ryan leaves Camilla on March 5, 2023, and moves out. Camilla pays all of the expenses relating to their 5-year-old son, who lives with her all year. Ryan refuses to file jointly with Camilla but also refuses to file for divorce or legal separation. What filing status is available to Camilla?

A. She can choose Married Filing Jointly or Single.  
B. She can choose Single or Married Filing Separately.  
C. **She can choose to file Head of Household or Married Filing Separately. correct**
D. She can choose to file Married Filing Jointly or Head of household.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 91% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Camilla may file as Married Filing Separately or as Head of Household. This is because she can be "considered unmarried" for tax purposes. Married taxpayers who lived apart from their spouse during the last six months of the year and provided for dependent children may be “considered unmarried” and qualify to file as Head of Household. 

To be "considered unmarried" at the end of a tax year, the taxpayer's spouse may not be a member of the household for the last 6 months of the tax year and the taxpayer must also have a qualifying dependent. In this scenario, Camilla's home must have been the main home of a child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half the year. Since her son lived with her all year, then she would qualify. She cannot file jointly (MFJ) with her estranged husband because, as the question states, he refuses to file jointly with her. In the case of an MFJ return, both spouses must agree to file jointly and sign the return.

9. Question ID: 94850155 (Topic: Filing Requirements and Due Date)

Percy filed his 2020 tax return late. He didn't file it until December 1, 2023. How long does the IRS have to audit the return and assess additional tax after Percy filed it?

A. The IRS must assess additional tax within six years from the received date of Percy's tax return.  
B. The IRS must assess additional tax within eighteen months from the original due date of the return.  
C. The IRS must assess additional tax within two years after Percy files it.  
D. **The IRS must assess additional tax within three years from the received date of Percy's tax return. correct**  

Study Unit 1: Preliminary Work with Taxpayer Data covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 74% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

The IRS must assess additional tax within three years from the received date of Percy's tax return. The general rule is that if the IRS wants to assess additional tax on a return, the assessment of tax must be made within three years from the received date of an original tax return or three years from the due date of the original return, whichever is later. Since Percy's return is delinquent, the IRS will have three years from the date they receive Percy's return to audit the return or assess additional tax. 

Note: There are some instances when the IRS has a longer time period to assess additional tax. If you omitted more than 25% of your gross income from a tax return, the time the IRS can assess additional tax increases from three to six years from the date your tax return was filed. On a fraudulent return, the IRS has an unlimited amount of time to assess tax.

14. Question ID: 97091963 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

Daniel is divorced and earns $70,000 in wages. He has several relatives which he supports. These relatives do not all live with him, but none earn any income. Which dependent relative may qualify Daniel for head of household filing status?

A. **A parent who lives in a retirement home, and not with Daniel. correct**  
B. A foster child who lived with Daniel for 3 months of the tax year.  
C. A cousin who lives with Daniel all year.  
D. An adult stepdaughter who lives in her own apartment who is supported by Daniel.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 79% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

A parent is the only dependent relative who does not have to live with Daniel for him to claim “head of household” status. In order to file for head of household, the “qualifying person” must be one of the following: a birth child, adopted child, grandchild, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of those, or a parent. The qualifying person must also LIVE WITH the taxpayer (unless the absence is temporary). The only exception to the “residency test” is a parent, who does not have to live with the taxpayer. A cousin does not qualify because they do not meet the relationship test. The adopted child does not qualify because the child lived with the taxpayer for less than one-half of the year.

17. Question ID: 94815894 (Topic: Taxpayer Filing Status)

For the purpose of determining filing status, which of the following taxpayers would be considered unmarried for the entire tax year and must file SINGLE in 2023? (None of the taxpayers listed below have any dependents).

A. **Halton, whose annulment was finalized on January 10, 2024. correct**  
B. Terrance, whose spouse died on February 1, 2023.  
C. Gregory, who got married on June 1, 2023 to a nonresident alien.  
D. Crystal, who got married on December 25, 2023.  

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 81% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for A:

Halton, whose annulment was finalized on January 10, 2024 would be considered UNMARRIED for all of 2023 as well as any prior years. Unlike divorce, which is the dissolution of a valid marriage, an annulment is retroactive and nullifies the marriage contract. If you obtain a court decree of annulment, which holds that no valid marriage ever existed, you are considered unmarried even if you filed joint returns for earlier years.

19. Question ID: 94850130 (Topic: Marriage Divorce and Injured and Innocent Spouse)

According to the IRS, which of the following factors do NOT weigh in favor of the IRS approving equitable relief?

A. Abuse by the spouse or former spouse.  
B. Poor mental or physical health on the date the taxpayer signed the return or requested relief.  
C. **The taxpayer requesting relief still living with his or her spouse. correct**
D. None of the above.  

Study Unit 1: Preliminary Work with Taxpayer Data covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 55% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

If the taxpayer requesting relief still lives with his or her spouse, it would be unfavorable, rather than favorable. “Equitable relief” is designed to provide tax relief from spousal liability (if a taxpayer can't get tax relief under innocent spouse relief or separation of liability). Equitable relief is offered by the IRS to those taxpayers that don't qualify for innocent spouse relief or relief by separation of liability. With equitable relief cases, the IRS looks to see if it would be unfair to hold the taxpayer liable for the taxes even if the taxpayer does not qualify for the other two forms of relief.
