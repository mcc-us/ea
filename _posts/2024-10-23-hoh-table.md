Additional Notes:

- Qualifying Person Exceptions: For a parent who qualifies as a dependent, the parent doesn't have to live with the taxpayer, but the taxpayer must provide more than half of the cost of the parent's household, whether or not the parent lives in the taxpayer's home.
- Non-Qualifying Expenses: The costs of maintaining the home exclude items like clothing, education, and vacations.

Example:

- Single Parent with One Child: Jane is unmarried, lives with her child (under age 18), and pays all household expenses. She meets the HOH requirements since her child is a qualifying person, and she provides more than half the cost of maintaining the home.
