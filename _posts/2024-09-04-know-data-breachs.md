Tax Tips: Sept 4, 2024

- **Know the potential signs of a data breach**

The IRS and [Security Summit](https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/protect-your-clients-protect-yourself-summer-2024) partners continue to see identity thieves targeting tax professionals in the hope of gaining client tax information.

**Speed is critical.**

1. **Tax pros should report data theft immediately.**

2. Tax professionals should watch for these **red flags**:
   1. Slow or unexpected computer or network responsiveness  
   1. Software is slow or actions take longer to process than usual.  
   1. Computer cursor moves or changes numbers without touching the mouse or keyboard.  
   1. Unexpectedly being locked out of a network or computer.  

3.  Client tax returns are being rejected because their Social Security number was already used for another return.

4.  IRS authentication letters (5071C, 6331C, 4883C, 5747C) are being received even though a tax return hasn't been filed.

5.  Getting more e-file receipt acknowledgements than the tax professional actually filed.

6.  The IRS disabled the tax professional’s online account.

7.  Tax transcripts are being delivered to the tax professional’s `Secure Object Repository` that have not been ordered.

8.  The IRS has notified that the tax professional’s Centralized Authorized File (CAF) number has been compromised.  
     - In case of a data breach, proactively safeguard the CAF number and consider requesting a new one for protection.

9.  Notification from the IRS regarding a client they do not represent.

10.  Report the incident to their local [IRS stakeholder liaison](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/stakeholder-liaison-local-contacts).  
     - IRS stakeholder liaisons will ensure all the appropriate IRS offices are alerted. 
     - If reported quickly, the IRS can take steps to block fraudulent returns in the clients' names and will assist tax pros through the process.

11.  Work with *cybersecurity experts and insurance companies* to obtain help and reduce the extent of the loss.

12.  Visit the `Federation of Tax Administrators` to find state contact information. Tax professionals can share information with the appropriate state tax agency by visiting [Report a Data Breach](https://taxadmin.org/report-a-data-breach/).

13.  **Be proactive** suggest getting an [Identity Protection PIN](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/security-summit-identity-protection-pins-are-an-important-tool-against-tax-related-identity-theft) or completing a [Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf), if applicable.
