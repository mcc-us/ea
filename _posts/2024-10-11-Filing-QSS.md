Filing Status: Qualifying Surviving Spouse (Qualifying Widow(er))

**Overview**:
The Qualifying Surviving Spouse status allows widowers to continue using Married Filing Jointly tax rates for up to two years after their spouse's death, providing tax benefits similar to those for married couples. To file as a Qualifying Surviving Spouse, **you must meet all the following conditions**:

1. You were eligible to file a joint return with your spouse in the year of their death.
2. Your spouse passed away within the last two years, and you have not remarried.
3. You have a dependent child (biological, stepchild, or adopted) who lived with you the entire year, and you can claim a child-related tax benefit.
4. You pay more than half the cost of maintaining your home, which is also the principal residence of the dependent child.

Tax Benefits:

1. You receive the Married Filing Jointly tax rates, typically lower than those for single or head-of-household filers.
2. You **qualify for a larger standard deduction** than filing as single or head of household.

Duration of Use:

1. You can use this status for two tax years following your spouse's death. In the year of the spouse's death, you typically file as Married Filing Jointly.

**Example**:

If your spouse died in 2023:

- For 2023, you file as Married Filing Jointly if eligible.
- For 2024 and 2025, you can file as a Qualifying Surviving Spouse if you meet the requirements.
- From 2026 onward, if you haven't remarried, you must file as Single or Head of Household (depending on your circumstances).

**Important Points**:

- This status provides tax relief to widows/ers with dependent children by extending the benefits of Married Filing Jointly for two years.
- You must maintain a home for a qualifying dependent to use this status.
- After two years, you must switch to a different filing status unless you remarry.
