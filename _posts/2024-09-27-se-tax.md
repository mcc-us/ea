Q1. Explain self-employment taxes. what are they specifically?

Self-Employment Taxes are taxes paid by individuals who work for themselves, rather than for an employer. They serve as a replacement for the employer portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes that are withheld from employees' paychecks.

Here's a breakdown of the two components:

1. Social Security Tax: This portion is calculated at a rate of 12.4% of your net earnings. However, you only pay half of this rate (6.2%) as a self-employed individual. The other half is considered an expense that can be deducted from your taxable income.
2. Medicare Tax: This portion is calculated at a rate of 2.9% of your net earnings. Similar to Social Security tax, you only pay half of this rate (1.45%) as a self-employed individual. The remaining 1.45% is considered an expense that can be deducted from your taxable income.

Note: If your net earnings exceed a certain threshold (which changes annually), you'll also need to pay an additional 0.9% Medicare tax.

In essence, self-employment taxes are a way to contribute to the Social Security and Medicare programs as a self-employed individual.
