Q. I am studying IRS tax regulations. I have a question regarding the "kiddie tax". What is it and how much is its limit?

- **The Kiddie Tax: A Brief Overview**

The kiddie tax is a federal tax that applies to certain dependent children who have unearned income (like interest, dividends, or capital gains) that exceeds a specific threshold. This tax is designed to prevent parents from avoiding taxes by transferring income-producing assets to their children.

How it works:
1. Threshold: If a dependent child under the age of 18 (or under 24 if a full-time student) has unearned income exceeding a certain amount, the kiddie tax applies.
2. Tax Rate: The portion of the child's unearned income that exceeds the threshold is taxed at the parent's marginal tax rate, not the child's.

Limit for 2024:

The specific limit for 2024 is $2,600. If a child's unearned income exceeds this amount, the kiddie tax will apply.

Note: There are some exceptions to the kiddie tax, such as for children who are earning income from a business or trade.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the IRS website: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc553

Would you like to know more about the kiddie tax, such as the exceptions or how to calculate it?
