Q. What is the "kiddie tax"? and what is it's limit?

Congress introduced the Kiddie tax 1986 to prevent parents from taking advantage of a tax loophole: Shifting wealth into their children’s name to avoid paying taxes on their taxable income. Before, the children’s investments were taxed at the child’s presumably lower tax rate.

For tax year 2024 (taxes filed in 2025), the kiddie tax threshold will rise to $2,600. Any unearned income over $2,600 is taxed at their parent or guardian’s marginal income tax rate, using IRS Form 8615. 

The kiddie tax is a federal tax that applies to certain dependent children who have unearned income (like interest, dividends, or capital gains) that exceeds a specific threshold (limit for 2024 is \$2,600). This tax is designed to prevent parents from avoiding taxes by transferring income-producing assets to their children.

The Kiddie Tax is a part of income tax rules that apply to individuals under 18 years and full-time students under 24 years of age. If the child’s unearned income, or investment income, is more than the Kiddie Tax threshold for the tax year, then the child must pay tax on any unearned income over the threshold. That means it gets taxed at the higher of the parents’ tax rate or the child’s tax rate. The IRS adjusts the Kiddie Tax for inflation each year.

The **Kiddie Tax only applies to unearned income**. It does not apply to earned income—the child’s salary or wages from working. That income is taxed at the child’s rate. However, the Kiddie Tax will still apply to the child’s unearned income if the requirements are met.

How it works:
1. Threshold: If a dependent child under the age of 18 (or under 24 if a full-time student) has unearned income exceeding a certain amount, the kiddie tax applies.
2. Tax Rate: The portion of the child's unearned income that exceeds the threshold is **taxed at the parent's marginal tax rate**, not the child's.


Note: There are some exceptions to the kiddie tax, such as for children who are earning income from a business or trade.
