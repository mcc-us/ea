This is a decision tree to help determine if someone is a:
- Resident Alien, 
- Nonresident Alien, or 
- Dual-Status Taxpayer

Based on U.S. tax law as outlined in IRS Pub. 519.

1. Do you hold a U.S. Green Card?
   - Yes → Resident Alien (for the entire year if held throughout the year).
   - No → Continue to next question.

2. Were you physically present in the U.S. for at least 31 days in the current year and/or 183 days during the last 3 years combined?
   - Yes → Resident Alien under the Substantial Presence Test.  
   - No → Continue to next question. 

> Counting days: most recent year = No. of days, 1/3 of the previous year's days, and 1/6 of the second previous year's days

3. Did you meet the Substantial Presence Test or hold a Green Card for only part of the year?
   - Yes → Dual-Status Taxpayer (resident for part of the year, nonresident for the other part).
   - No → Nonresident Alien.

- **Questions**

1. Do you have a Green Card?
2. Were you in the U.S. enough to meet the **Substantial Presence Test**?
3. Did your status change during the year (from resident to nonresident or vice versa)?
