    C. Singlecorrect
    D. Head of Householdwrong

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 71% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Francine is not married, and she cannot claim her son as a dependent or use him as her qualifying child for Head of Household. Barron does not meet the "age" test for a qualifying child, because he is not a full-time student. And he does not meet the gross income test for a qualifying relative, because he made more than the deemed exemption amount of $4,700 in 2023. Therefore, she must file her return using the "single" filing status.

    A. Married filing separately.
    B. Either single or head of household.wrong
    C. Single.correct
    D. Head of household.

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 84% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for C:

Even though Wyatt provided all of Florinda's financial support and she lived with him all year, he does not qualify for head of household because Florinda is not a qualifying person for purposes of the HOH status. For HOH filing status, the qualifying person generally must be related to the taxpayer either by blood, adoption, or marriage (with an exception for foster children legally placed in a home).  Florinda is an unrelated person (his girlfriend) so she is not a qualifying individual for Wyatt to file as head of household, even if he provides all of her support.

Ginny can only file Single. Denny is 21 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be his mother's qualifying child. Although Denny only worked part-time, he earned too much for Ginny to claim him as a qualifying relative dependent. Therefore, Ginny must file Single. She cannot file Head of Household because she does not have a qualifying dependent.

Study Unit 2: Determining Filing Status and Residency covers the information for this question.

This question is answered correctly on the first attempt by 75% of students.

Correct Answer Explanation for D:

Manny must file "Single". He cannot file as Head of Household and claim his son, Franklin, as a dependent, because Franklin is 23 and was not a full-time student during the tax year, so he cannot be Manny's qualifying child. Although Franklin only worked part-time, he earned too much for his father to claim him as a "qualifying relative" dependent. Therefore, Manny cannot file Head of Household because he does not have a qualifying person. (Question modified from an example in Publication 4491).

Since Rhett was still alive in 2023 and they were married for the entire taxable year, Molly's filing status for 2023 would be Married filing jointly or Married Filing Separately.
