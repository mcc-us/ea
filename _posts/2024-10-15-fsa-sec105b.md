#### Section 105 - Amounts Received Under Accident and Health Plans

- **Issue**: Can an employee exclude from their gross income the reimbursements they receive from their employer for medicines, drugs, or dietary supplements purchased without a doctor's prescription?

- **Facts**: An employer, N, offers a health flexible spending arrangement (FSA) to its employees. This FSA reimburses employees for medical expenses not covered by insurance.

Employee A, who participates in the FSA, buys an antacid, allergy medicine, pain reliever, and cold medicine from a pharmacy without a prescription. These items are for personal use, or for Aâ€™s spouse or dependents, to treat sickness or injury. Employee A also buys dietary supplements, such as vitamins, without a prescription to maintain general health for themselves or their family.

Employee A submits claims for all these expenses (from the current plan year) to the FSA for reimbursement and has not been reimbursed for these costs by insurance or any other source.

- **Law and Analysis**:

> Under Section 61(a)(1), gross income includes all forms of compensation unless otherwise excluded by law.
>
> Section 105(a) generally says that any amounts an employee receives for personal injury or sickness through employer health insurance should be included in gross income if the employer contributed to the plan.

However, Section 105(b) provides an exception: amounts reimbursed for medical care expenses (as defined by Section 213(d)) do not need to be included in gross income, as long as they are for the employee, their spouse, or dependents.

**In short, if the reimbursed expenses qualify as "medical care," they can be excluded from income under Section 105(b).**
