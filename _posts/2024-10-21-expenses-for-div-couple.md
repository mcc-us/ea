---

**Question**: Jackie and Keoni are divorced and their 10-year-old daughter lives with Jackie. Keoni pays child support to Jackie. Jackie is trying to decide if she qualifies to file as Head of Household. What expense should she NOT include when calculating if she pays more than half the cost of keeping up the home?

A. Mortgage interest.  
B. The cost of textbooks for her daughter.  
C. Food eaten at home.  
D. Property taxes on the home.  

**Answer**: The correct answer is B. The cost of textbooks for her daughter.

**Explanation**: When determining if Jackie qualifies to file as Head of Household, she must pay more than half the cost of keeping up the home. According to IRS guidelines, qualifying expenses for keeping up a home include things like mortgage interest, property taxes, rent, utilities, and food consumed in the home. However, the cost of textbooks (or other personal expenses like clothing, education, or medical care) is not considered part of the cost of keeping up a home.

Thus, textbooks should not be included when calculating the costs for Head of Household status.

See: IRS **Publication 501** provides further details on this requirement.
