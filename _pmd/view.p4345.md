## Summary: Taxability of Court-Awarded Settlements

Court awarded cash settlements may consist of multiple elements, *for example*, back pay, emotional distress, medical, and attorneys' fees.

### 1. Personal physical injuries or physical sickness 

  - **General Rule**: If you receive money due to an injury or illness, it's not considered taxable income.
  - **Exception**: If you deducted medical expenses (in a prior year) related to your injury or illness, the portion you deducted will become taxable income.
  - **Reporting**: You need to report this taxable portion as "Other Income" on your tax return.

NOTE: How to Determine Taxable Amount: If your medical expenses were deducted over multiple years, you need to figure out how much of the settlement corresponds to the medical costs deducted in each year.

### 2. Emotional distress or mental anguish

- Emotional distress is treated the same as physical injuries, with exceptions.

  - However, If you receive money for emotional distress that does not originate from an injury or illness, THEN you must include it as income.

### 3. Lost wages or lost profits

  - If you receive money from an unlawful discrimination or involuntary termination suit, for example, severance pay, back pay, or front pay, this IS taxable.

  - SS and Medicare should be remitted by the payer on your behalf and reported as wages using 1040 Line 1a.
  
  - If you lose lost profits, these proceeds are taxable and must be included in business revenue.

### 4. Property Loss-in-value

  - If you are awarded less than the basis of lost property, then you must reduce your cost basis. 
  - If you awarded more than your cost of basis, then the excess is income.


### 5. Extras

  - Interest collected is generally taxable.  
  - Punitive damages are taxable.  
  - If you receive money exceeding your cost basis, then you may be required to make estimated payments.
  - If you receive government assistance for health insurance through the Marketplace, it's crucial to report any significant life changes, such as income increases, to the Marketplace. This ensures accurate credit calculations and prevents potential over-payments.
